Hi, 



I have an 11 yo female patient with Addison disease who is moving to Orlando next month. I last saw her in August; family is very compliant. I will set them up with enough refills, but she will need follow up in Feb 2025. Are you or do you know of anyone
 who would be able to see her? 


Thanks,
Maggie

Subject: [peds-endo] Hypercalcemia Case
 



Good-evening!

 

Our team would like some help re a challenging case of hypercalcemia.  Patient is a 15 mo female with a history of developmental delay who recently presented with weight loss of 6 lbs over 2-3 months.  She also had vomiting, decrease in appetite, irritability,
 constipation as well as polyuria prior to presentation.  She was admitted to the hospital for further management.  She is at the 48th percentile for weight and 40th percentile for length on admission. 

 

She had severe hypercalcemia (16.8 mg/dL) on admission with suppressed intact PTH < 6 pg/mL (reference range 15-65).  On admission, she has normal Phos 5.7 mg/dL (4.1-6) , low alk phos 80 IU/L (reference range 142-335).  25-OH vitamin D was normal at 36.3 ng/mL. 
 1,25-OH vitamin D was appropriately low at 10 pg/mL (reference range 40.3-112.4).  Repeat Alk Phos consistently low at 70 IU/L.  Magnesium was 2.7 mg/dL on admission (1.5- 2.3).   Ca/Cr ratio unable to be calculated due to undetectable Cr and Ca Conc, urine
 was 1.4 mg/dL (0.5 - 35).  On admission, Ca conc was 6 mg/dL (but no urine Cr done).  

 

Her CBC initially showed WBC 22.5, Hgb 8.1 g/dL, Hct 25%, platelets 489,000, MCV 86.6 and smudge cells visualized.  Inflammatory markers were elevated on admission with ESR 35 mm/hr (reference range 0-20) and CRP 32 mg/L (reference range < 10). LDH was normal
 210 U/L (reference range 120-246) and uric acid was normal 3.3 mg/dL (reference range 1.7-4.7). Abdominal U/S showed nephrocalcinosis. We were concerned about hypercalcemia of malignancy. Pediatric Heme-Onc recommended further testing which included imaging.
   CXR negative.  MRI of brain and spine negative. Neuroblastoma urine studies pending.  PTH-RP recently resulted and is undetectable (< 2 pmol/L).  Hematology-Oncology have low suspicion for hypercalcemia of malignancy at this point.  

Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia.  ECHO is normal.  Vitamin B6 levels 27.3 mcg/L (3.5 – 65.2). 

 

She initially responded to IVF and one dose of Lasix.  Calcium came down to normal levels.  IVF were stopped and patient started to have better PO intake.  Over the last week, she has had increasing Calcium levels.  Her ionized calcium is now 1.57 mmol/L (1.09
 – 1.30) and corrected serum calcium is 13.6 mg/dL.  We have tried Calcitonin for 36 hours and she responded to that but once again has had increasing calcium levels once that was stopped. 

 

We have a CGH array pending to evaluate for William Syndrome.  Nephrolithiasis panel from Invitae is also pending.   Neuroblastoma urine studies pending.  

 

What else do we need to consider/missing? Any ideas for treatment options while we await
 genetic testing which will hopefully be more revealing?  Could this still be hypophosphatasia with normal B6 levels?

109657293,Michael Levine,"Nov 18, 2024 11:57pm","Dear Bhavana ,
 
If vitamin D metabolites are low, as they are, it is difficult to conceive that this is Williams syndrome or idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. The Nephrolithiasis gene panel will be interesting, but most
 of the genes on are that panel are related to hypercalciuria and not hypercalcemia. It seems to me that this patient has a primary problem with excess bone resorption and not renal calcium loss. But I look forward to the results!
 
The low alk phos is concerning for hypophosphatasia, but the normal B6 and absence of “rickets” on x rays is somewhat reassuring that HPP is unlikely to be the answer. I would repeat the B6 level however and
 consider checking urine phosphoethanol, but I think that HPP with this degree of hypercalcemia would be expected to show a rickets-like mineralization defect (assuming that your bone survey included metaphases).  Nevertheless, there is clearly is an imbalance
 between bone formation (low) and bone resorption (? CTX) which is probably normal or even elevated. Anti-resorptives are to be expected to be effective, as you have indicated a good response to calcitonin; the back up is iv bisphosphonates. I would continue
 to use CT until tachyphylaxis occurs, which is less common in kids than adults. 

 
Hyperthyroidism can cause this picture but alk phos is usually normal or elevated.  I think that the low alk phos is trying to tell us something. Low alk phos like this can also be seen in malnutrition and
 malignancy…and HIV or other viruses (EBV) that can cause hypercalcemia. Multiple myeloma is the classic case of low bone formation and increased bone resorption, but this is VERY rare in kids.

 
The nephrocalcinosis is consistent with chronic hypercalciuria which became hypercalcemia as GFR dropped. You did not mention her admission serum creatinine.  
The normal PTHrP is good, but I have seen some cases of B cell ALL present like this and bone marrow aspirate was needed for diagnosis. Given that you have done so much at this point and come up dry, I would
 push for bone marrow analysis. Might be a viral infection as well, which could have tipped the infant over in terms of hydration, leading to worsening and more clinically worrisome hypercalcemia.  
 
Lastly, another thing to consider is disaccharidase deficiency, which would be entirely consistent with this case (except for the inflammatory markers).  The inflammatory markers could be red herring and might
 just signal an intercurrent viral infection (vida supra).
 
Have you checked parental bone/mineral studies?
 
Finally, I note a tone desperation and even some frustration that saline and loop diuretics and then a few doses of CT did not “cure” the patient. These treatments are like a bandaid and you have to find the
 primary CAUSE of the hypercalcemia to effect a durable resolution (BONUS: can you provide me with a reference to primary data that show that loop diuretics plus saline are better than hyperhydration alone as a treatment for hypercalcemia when a patient can
 tolerate hyperhydration?). 
  
You have done a great job thus far with your work-up!

 undiagnosed. ABCD syndrome responds well to a low calcium diet. It sounds like they are off formula, but do you know if they are on a normal diet, or a low calcium one? I'm also curious to hear back if you end up looking into disaccharidase deficiency.

Subject: Re: [peds-endo] Hypercalcemia Case
 


Good-morning, 
 
Thank you all for the suggestions in regards to the child with hypercalcemia.  I wanted to provide an update and see if any other work-up recommended.  Briefly,  this is a 15 mo with hx of developmental delay who presented with weight loss and found to
 have hypercalcemia with suppressed intact PTH.  No Vitamin A supplementation.  She was Similac 360 Total formula until 12 mo of age and then switched to Almond milk given ongoing concerns about constipation (per parent).  Her serum Cr on admission was elevated
 at 0.84 mg/dL (0.3 - 0.7).  
 
Patient did end up getting a bone marrow biopsy which was normal.  CGH array which was sent to eval for Williams Syndrome also negative.  Repeat B6 level 16.3 mcg/dL (3.4 - 65.2).  Urine phosphoethanolamine is normal at 205 mcmol/g Cr (83-222).  Invitae
 Nephrolithiasis panel negative as well.  EBV panel negative.  Abd US showed nephrocalcinosis but otherwise negative.  
 
We were initially suspecting HPP given persistent low Alk phos so bisphosphonate tx was not initiated however given all the clinical information, we did proceed with pamidronate infusion.  She received a total of 0.75 mg/kg and had subsequent low phos
 and calcium was 8.5 mg/dL (9.3 - 10.6) seven days after infusion.  She was briefly on Calcium carbonate and phosphorous supplementation.  However, 3 weeks after her bisphosphonate infusion, her calcium is uptrending again and is now at 10.8 mg/dL.  Cr is 0.30
 mg/dL, phos is 4.4 mg/dL.  She is off all supplementation and no multivitamin either when this repeat study was done.  
 
Urine Neuroblastoma panel - we need to re-obtain sample.  As Dr. Levine mentioned, I am going to look into disaccharidase deficiency.  Anything else I need to evaluate for?  
 
Thank you again and happy holidays! 
 
Bhavana Narala

Hello,


 


I have a 7-year-old patient with autism that has been found to have DIO2 rs225014 homozygous genotype and they are seeking advice on next steps. Thyroid function tests have been repeated multiple times by an outside provider and have largely
 been normal including negative thyroid antibodies, and normal TSH and free T4. Most recently, T3 testing as below were
very mildly low but likely aren't contributing to any of the symptoms family is noting (sweating/heat intolerance, difficulty concentrating/focusing, fatigue, increased hunger, irritability, anxiety). Family is seeking advice from an endocrinology expert
 in thisDIO2 genetic finding despite reassurance, so I'm wondering if anyone has seen this genetic finding and can add any thoughts!

110187391,"Bauer, Andrew","Dec 18, 2024 10:51pm","Hi Rachel,




The Thr92 substitution (Thr92Ala-DIO2) is the most studied, and likely clinically relevant, polymorphism associated with decreased deiodinase activity. Your patient's thyroid profile is consistent with this observation. 




What to do about it is more difficult as the associations with clinical symptoms/disease have not been reproduced in across populations. In addition, there are no studies in pediatrics to show clinical significance for the polymorphism, especially in patients
 with a eutopic thyroid and normal function, and no studies to explore the potential benefit for combined LT4/LT3 therapy. 




Even in patients with a normal TSH, there is on-going research to determine if reduced T3 and thyroid hormone signaling disrupts normal cellular function with the potential to lead to an increased life-time risk for elevated BMI, insulin resistance, hypertension,
 degenerative brain disease and other conditions, in certain populations. 




Tony Bianco at the University of Chicago is one of the world's experts on deiodinases (https://profiles.uchicago.edu/profiles/display/14536391 and

110152592,Michael Levine,"Dec 16, 2024 10:32pm","Interesting case.
I agree that the 1,25 level is tres high, and the 25D level aint too shabby, either. BTW, please stop writing “vitamin D” when you mean “25-hydroxyvitamin D.” Thanks.
 
The PTH is quite high and given the alleged appearance of osteopenia, the fragility fractures, and the elevated alk phos (? From bone presumably), it is reasonable to conclude that the elevated
 PTH is real and not an artifact (e.g. high dose biotin or heterophile antibody can cause falsely elevated PTH).
 
The PTH is high enough to explain the elevated 1,25 level; OTOH, we always worry about 3-epimers of 25D and 1,25D that can cause falsely high levels in some assays such as ELISA so double checking
 in tandem mass spec may make sense. 
 
The overall situation here is likely secondary hyperparathyroidism, even in the setting of normal serum calcium level. The loop diuretics may be inducing renal calcium loss (what is the urine
 ca:cr ratio and what does renal US show?) and the past history of NEC may reduce absorptive capacity, so net negative calcium balance. Baby may need more calcium, and giving and iv infusion of calcium to see if PTH comes down would be a good test.

 
The fly in this ointment is the very normal serum phosphate level; you have to be asking yourself, “why isn’t the renal proximal tubule responding to the very high PTH and ripping those sodium
 phosphate co-transporters off the plasma membrane, which of course would reduce the TmP/GFR and cause hypophosphatemia?”  At least that the question I am asking.  
 
PTH resistance is unusual at this age in kids with PHP1a or PHP1b, but I have seen PTH resistance at this age in acrodysostosis. But not this severe. And the kids with acrodysostosis have short
 finger at this age. Very short fingers. 
 
Another thought: biallelic LOF variants in Klotho. Michael Econs reported a case some years ago of a 13 year old girl with elevated levels of 1,25D and phosphate as well as (wait for it…) PTH
 and calcium.  The PTH was not as high as this case, and the patient had hypercalcemia. But she was older. Skeletal radiographs revealed diffuse osteopenia; patchy sclerosis in the hands, feet, long bones and calvariae; intracranial calcifications (Figure 1A);
 as well as metacarpal periosteal reaction. And FGF23 was very high. So perhaps worth checking the FGF23 in your patient.

 
By the way, I have seen acquired PTH resistance in cases of severe hypocalcemia, but that is the not the case here.  Although PHP1 is possible (and easy to check for PHP1a and PHP1b at Greenwood
 Genetics where they do the GNAS methylation testing and GNAS sequencing), if the FGF23 is not elevated my guess is that there is some sort of renal dysplasia. In either case, if you cannot get more enteral calcium in due to NEC effects or ? (we have seen calcium
 malabsorption with G-J tube feedings where the J port was distal to region of gut where maximal calcium is absorbed), you would need to give calcium iv. I agree that giving more 1,25 at this point might seem counterproductive (as very high 1,25 increases bone
 resorption, and you don’t want to do that), but if you can lower the PTH by giving more calcitriol it might be worth a shot. Having said that, another thought. Some folks think that it is conversion of 25D to 1,25D INSIDE the parathyroid cell that decreases
 PTH production and secretion, so perhaps give more vitamin D3 and get the 25D level up to 50 ng/mL and see what happens. The Renal community is all about giving calcifediol (25D) these days to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism.

 
By the way, how is the kiddo growing? What are total calcium and phos intakes from DIET as well as supplements?  I would definitely NOT give more phosphate to this kiddo.  that would drive
 the PTH up further.  
 
But overall, if we ignore the zebras and focus on the horses, I suspect some degree of renal dysplasia, even with normal serum creatinine (muscle mass may be so low that serum creatinine is
 not a good biomarker; perhaps check cystatin C and urinary retinol binding protein or beta2 microglobulin).

 
Finally, given the congenital defects, have  you checked a SNP microarray?

Hi everyone!
 
I hope this email finds you well. I was reaching out to you today for your recommendations on a patient in our Cardiac ICU with osteopenia and pathologic fractures.

 
Please find a summary below about her:
 
10-month-old former 35-week gestation twin with tricuspid atresia, VSD, double outlet right ventricle, mitral regurgitation as well as history of necrotizing enterocolitis who has pretty much lived most of her life in our cardiac ICU. 
 She has been on respiratory support, TPN, diuretics-all risk factors for osteopenia.
 
In October 2024, she sustained a left femur fracture-with routine handling.  At that time, she was noted to have a healing right proximal knee femur fracture as well as fracture of the right distal radial metaphysis with diffuse demineralization. 
 At some point she was started on calcium carbonate-current doses 20 mg of elemental calcium per kilogram per day.  Her serum calcium and serum phosphorus levels are normal.  Serum phosphorus is around 6 mg/dL.  Initial vitamin D was 17 ng/ml and most recent
 vitamin D level is 27ng/ml.  Vitamin D supplementation increased from 400 units daily to 600 units daily.  Her parathyroid hormone level remains elevated.
 
She now has new bilateral femur fractures.
 
Would you do anything else for her?  I know that we sometimes use calcitriol in these patients but given the already high 1, 25 vitamin D I am not sure she needs that.  Additionally, I do not know if you would recommend starting phosphorus
 when her phosphorus is normal.
 
I appreciate any input! Thank you for your time!

Thank you for you inputs and education.
 
I apologize about ""vitamin D"".  I did mean 25-hydroxy vitamin D.
 
To answer some of your questions: The patient does not have short fingers.  Whole exome sequencing was performed, and the result is ""negative"".  I plan to discuss this further
 with our geneticist.  She is gaining weight well and appears to have a normal growth velocity, but length is at the 0.3 percentile on a WHO girls growth chart (Z= -2.74).
 
We will obtain urine calcium and urine creatinine to assess for urinary calcium loss as well as a Cystatin C level and urinary retinal binding protein.  We will obtain an FGF23
 level.  We will work on bringing up the 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels and start calcitriol while monitoring the parathyroid hormone levels along with a serum calcium and phosphorus levels.  We will also administer calcium supplementation intravenously and assess
 the PTH response.
 
I will keep you updated.
 
Thank you again for your valuable input.  It has been very helpful in managing outpatient.
 
Kind regards,
Shilpa

Interesting case. I agree that the 1,25 level is tres high, and the 25D level aint too shabby, either. BTW, please stop writing “vitamin D” when you mean “25-hydroxyvitamin
 D. ” Thanks. The PTH is quite high and given

Interesting case.
I agree that the 1,25 level is tres high, and the 25D level aint too shabby, either. BTW, please stop writing “vitamin D” when you mean “25-hydroxyvitamin
 D.” Thanks.
 
The PTH is quite high and given the alleged appearance of osteopenia, the fragility fractures, and the elevated alk phos (? From bone presumably),
 it is reasonable to conclude that the elevated PTH is real and not an artifact (e.g. high dose biotin or heterophile antibody can cause falsely elevated PTH).
 
The PTH is high enough to explain the elevated 1,25 level; OTOH, we always worry about 3-epimers of 25D and 1,25D that can cause falsely high
 levels in some assays such as ELISA so double checking in tandem mass spec may make sense.

 
The overall situation here is likely secondary hyperparathyroidism, even in the setting of normal serum calcium level. The loop diuretics may
 be inducing renal calcium loss (what is the urine ca:cr ratio and what does renal US show?) and the past history of NEC may reduce absorptive capacity, so net negative calcium balance. Baby may need more calcium, and giving and iv infusion of calcium to see
 if PTH comes down would be a good test. 
 
The fly in this ointment is the very normal serum phosphate level; you have to be asking yourself, “why isn’t the renal proximal tubule responding
 to the very high PTH and ripping those sodium phosphate co-transporters off the plasma membrane, which of course would reduce the TmP/GFR and cause hypophosphatemia?”  At least that the question I am asking.  
 
PTH resistance is unusual at this age in kids with PHP1a or PHP1b, but I have seen PTH resistance at this age in acrodysostosis. But not this
 severe. And the kids with acrodysostosis have short finger at this age. Very short fingers.

 
Another thought: biallelic LOF variants in Klotho. Michael Econs reported a case some years ago of a 13 year old girl with elevated levels
 of 1,25D and phosphate as well as (wait for it…) PTH and calcium.  The PTH was not as high as this case, and the patient had hypercalcemia. But she was older. Skeletal radiographs revealed diffuse osteopenia; patchy sclerosis in the hands, feet, long bones
 and calvariae; intracranial calcifications (Figure 1A); as well as metacarpal periosteal reaction. And FGF23 was very high. So perhaps worth checking the FGF23 in your patient.

 
By the way, I have seen acquired PTH resistance in cases of severe hypocalcemia, but that is the not the case here.  Although PHP1 is possible
 (and easy to check for PHP1a and PHP1b at Greenwood Genetics where they do the GNAS methylation testing and GNAS sequencing), if the FGF23 is not elevated my guess is that there is some sort of renal dysplasia. In either case, if you cannot get more enteral
 calcium in due to NEC effects or ? (we have seen calcium malabsorption with G-J tube feedings where the J port was distal to region of gut where maximal calcium is absorbed), you would need to give calcium iv. I agree that giving more 1,25 at this point might
 seem counterproductive (as very high 1,25 increases bone resorption, and you don’t want to do that), but if you can lower the PTH by giving more calcitriol it might be worth a shot. Having said that, another thought. Some folks think that it is conversion
 of 25D to 1,25D INSIDE the parathyroid cell that decreases PTH production and secretion, so perhaps give more vitamin D3 and get the 25D level up to 50 ng/mL and see what happens. The Renal community is all about giving calcifediol (25D) these days to treat
 secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
 
By the way, how is the kiddo growing? What are total calcium and phos intakes from DIET as well as supplements?  I would definitely NOT give
 more phosphate to this kiddo.  that would drive the PTH up further.  
 
But overall, if we ignore the zebras and focus on the horses, I suspect some degree of renal dysplasia, even with normal serum creatinine (muscle
 mass may be so low that serum creatinine is not a good biomarker; perhaps check cystatin C and urinary retinol binding protein or beta2 microglobulin).

 
Finally, given the congenital defects, have  you checked a SNP microarray?

Hi everyone!
 
I hope this email finds you well. I was reaching out to you today for your recommendations on a patient in our Cardiac ICU with osteopenia and pathologic fractures.

 
Please find a summary below about her:
 
10-month-old former 35-week gestation twin with tricuspid atresia, VSD, double outlet right ventricle, mitral regurgitation as well as history of necrotizing enterocolitis
 who has pretty much lived most of her life in our cardiac ICU.  She has been on respiratory support, TPN, diuretics-all risk factors for osteopenia.
 
In October 2024, she sustained a left femur fracture-with routine handling.  At that time, she was noted to have a healing right proximal knee femur fracture as well as fracture
 of the right distal radial metaphysis with diffuse demineralization.  At some point she was started on calcium carbonate-current doses 20 mg of elemental calcium per kilogram per day.  Her serum calcium and serum phosphorus levels are normal.  Serum phosphorus
 is around 6 mg/dL.  Initial vitamin D was 17 ng/ml and most recent vitamin D level is 27ng/ml.  Vitamin D supplementation increased from 400 units daily to 600 units daily.  Her parathyroid hormone level remains elevated.
 
She now has new bilateral femur fractures.
 
Would you do anything else for her?  I know that we sometimes use calcitriol in these patients but given the already high 1, 25 vitamin D I am not sure she needs that.  Additionally,
 I do not know if you would recommend starting phosphorus when her phosphorus is normal.
 
I appreciate any input! Thank you for your time!

We will obtain urine calcium and urine creatinine to assess for urinary calcium loss as well as a Cystatin C level and urinary retinal binding protein.  We will obtain an FGF23
 level.  We will work on bringing up the 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels and start calcitriol while monitoring the parathyroid hormone levels along with a serum calcium and phosphorus levels.  We will also administer calcium supplementation intravenously and assess
 the PTH response.
 
I will keep you updated.
 
Thank you again for your valuable input.  It has been very helpful in managing outpatient.
 
Kind regards,
Shilpa

Interesting case. I agree that the 1,25 level is tres high, and the 25D level aint too shabby, either. BTW, please stop writing “vitamin D” when you mean “25-hydroxyvitamin
 D. ” Thanks. The PTH is quite high and given

Interesting case.
I agree that the 1,25 level is tres high, and the 25D level aint too shabby, either. BTW, please stop writing “vitamin D” when you mean “25-hydroxyvitamin
 D.” Thanks.
 
The PTH is quite high and given the alleged appearance of osteopenia, the fragility fractures, and the elevated alk phos (? From bone presumably),
 it is reasonable to conclude that the elevated PTH is real and not an artifact (e.g. high dose biotin or heterophile antibody can cause falsely elevated PTH).
 
The PTH is high enough to explain the elevated 1,25 level; OTOH, we always worry about 3-epimers of 25D and 1,25D that can cause falsely high
 levels in some assays such as ELISA so double checking in tandem mass spec may make sense.

 
The overall situation here is likely secondary hyperparathyroidism, even in the setting of normal serum calcium level. The loop diuretics may
 be inducing renal calcium loss (what is the urine ca:cr ratio and what does renal US show?) and the past history of NEC may reduce absorptive capacity, so net negative calcium balance. Baby may need more calcium, and giving and iv infusion of calcium to see
 if PTH comes down would be a good test. 
 
The fly in this ointment is the very normal serum phosphate level; you have to be asking yourself, “why isn’t the renal proximal tubule responding
 to the very high PTH and ripping those sodium phosphate co-transporters off the plasma membrane, which of course would reduce the TmP/GFR and cause hypophosphatemia?”  At least that the question I am asking.  
 
PTH resistance is unusual at this age in kids with PHP1a or PHP1b, but I have seen PTH resistance at this age in acrodysostosis. But not this
 severe. And the kids with acrodysostosis have short finger at this age. Very short fingers.

 
Another thought: biallelic LOF variants in Klotho. Michael Econs reported a case some years ago of a 13 year old girl with elevated levels
 of 1,25D and phosphate as well as (wait for it…) PTH and calcium.  The PTH was not as high as this case, and the patient had hypercalcemia. But she was older. Skeletal radiographs revealed diffuse osteopenia; patchy sclerosis in the hands, feet, long bones
 and calvariae; intracranial calcifications (Figure 1A); as well as metacarpal periosteal reaction. And FGF23 was very high. So perhaps worth checking the FGF23 in your patient.

 
By the way, I have seen acquired PTH resistance in cases of severe hypocalcemia, but that is the not the case here.  Although PHP1 is possible
 (and easy to check for PHP1a and PHP1b at Greenwood Genetics where they do the GNAS methylation testing and GNAS sequencing), if the FGF23 is not elevated my guess is that there is some sort of renal dysplasia. In either case, if you cannot get more enteral
 calcium in due to NEC effects or ? (we have seen calcium malabsorption with G-J tube feedings where the J port was distal to region of gut where maximal calcium is absorbed), you would need to give calcium iv. I agree that giving more 1,25 at this point might
 seem counterproductive (as very high 1,25 increases bone resorption, and you don’t want to do that), but if you can lower the PTH by giving more calcitriol it might be worth a shot. Having said that, another thought. Some folks think that it is conversion
 of 25D to 1,25D INSIDE the parathyroid cell that decreases PTH production and secretion, so perhaps give more vitamin D3 and get the 25D level up to 50 ng/mL and see what happens. The Renal community is all about giving calcifediol (25D) these days to treat
 secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
 
By the way, how is the kiddo growing? What are total calcium and phos intakes from DIET as well as supplements?  I would definitely NOT give
 more phosphate to this kiddo.  that would drive the PTH up further.  
 
But overall, if we ignore the zebras and focus on the horses, I suspect some degree of renal dysplasia, even with normal serum creatinine (muscle
 mass may be so low that serum creatinine is not a good biomarker; perhaps check cystatin C and urinary retinol binding protein or beta2 microglobulin).

 
Finally, given the congenital defects, have  you checked a SNP microarray?

Hi everyone!
 
I hope this email finds you well. I was reaching out to you today for your recommendations on a patient in our Cardiac ICU with osteopenia and pathologic fractures.

 
Please find a summary below about her:
 
10-month-old former 35-week gestation twin with tricuspid atresia, VSD, double outlet right ventricle, mitral regurgitation as well as history of necrotizing enterocolitis
 who has pretty much lived most of her life in our cardiac ICU.  She has been on respiratory support, TPN, diuretics-all risk factors for osteopenia.
 
In October 2024, she sustained a left femur fracture-with routine handling.  At that time, she was noted to have a healing right proximal knee femur fracture as well as fracture
 of the right distal radial metaphysis with diffuse demineralization.  At some point she was started on calcium carbonate-current doses 20 mg of elemental calcium per kilogram per day.  Her serum calcium and serum phosphorus levels are normal.  Serum phosphorus
 is around 6 mg/dL.  Initial vitamin D was 17 ng/ml and most recent vitamin D level is 27ng/ml.  Vitamin D supplementation increased from 400 units daily to 600 units daily.  Her parathyroid hormone level remains elevated.
 
She now has new bilateral femur fractures.
 
Would you do anything else for her?  I know that we sometimes use calcitriol in these patients but given the already high 1, 25 vitamin D I am not sure she needs that.  Additionally,
 I do not know if you would recommend starting phosphorus when her phosphorus is normal.
 
I appreciate any input! Thank you for your time!

Your response is a bit confusing. Are you saying that karyotype was normal? Even with normal height it is reasonable to look for TS mosaic I think. Or even a deletion of Xq rather than Xp. I would certainly image the ovaries. The normal
 Testo level with elevated DHEA suggests to me that the DHEA may not be coming from the adrenal. There are some reports of gonadoblastomas that can produce DHEA in the setting of POI. I don’t think you know for certain that the DHEA is of adrenal origin unless
 you have done ACTH suppression test, right? did dex suppress the DHEA?
 
Also, how were the DHEA and DHEAS assays done?  Possible heterophile antibody interference??

Dhea/dheas not measure when the dex suppression was done.




While the ovaries could produce dhea, my understanding is that the ovaries do not have sulfatase activity, so that dheas is a reasonably specific product of adrenal androgen origin.  so if the VERY high dheas is from adrenal, it seems very unlikely the mildly
 elevated dhea is from the ovary - especially an ovary that can't make any estradiol or amh.




I wondered about an assay issue with dheas and tried to get the lab to do dilutions - unfortunately, couldn't be done at the hopkins lab, and my control of what they do at labcorp is limited, so they were not able to do the dilutions.  i agree it may be worth
 trying to look for an artifact, but with 17ohp, 17ohpreg, cortisol, all being ""reasonable"" and all being measured by immunoassay, an antibody artifact seems unlikely at this point.




I think turner mosaic VERY unlikely with normal stature.  I might think of turner mosaic if it was gonadal dysgenesis with xo/xy, but the lack of virilization/meaningful testosterone to me makes that VERY unlikely.  And gonadal dysgenesis doesn't explain the
 issue that makes this different than the usual poi patient - the elevated dheas.  without the elevated dheas there is no reason to explore anything beyond the usual differential for poi.  




She will undoubtably get a karyotype/snp array in her evaluation of the POI, but i will be very surprised if that is the answer (but of course....I have been surprised before.)

DHEA-Sulfate (Serum): 914.0 (H) (C) mcg/dl (110-433)


 


One consideration was steroid sulfatase deficiency.  This was particularly a question since she seemed to have no virilization, in spite of such a high DHEAS. 
 But since DHEA is also high, that doesn't seem to fit.  (although dheas is more elevated than dhea).


3BHSD doesn't fit with low 17OHP and 17OHPreg.


 


Anyone have thoughts on the high DHEAS?  Can anyone connect it to the POI?  Can someone connect steroid sulfatase deficiency with POI?

Hello David,
 
Your response is a bit confusing. Are you saying that karyotype was normal? Even with normal height it is reasonable to look for TS mosaic I think. Or even a deletion of Xq rather than Xp. I would certainly image the ovaries. The normal
 Testo level with elevated DHEA suggests to me that the DHEA may not be coming from the adrenal. There are some reports of gonadoblastomas that can produce DHEA in the setting of POI. I don’t think you know for certain that the DHEA is of adrenal origin unless
 you have done ACTH suppression test, right? did dex suppress the DHEA?
 
Also, how were the DHEA and DHEAS assays done?  Possible heterophile antibody interference??

Yes, she clearly has premature ovarian failure (sorry; POI (premature ovarian insufficiency) I believe is the current preferred term for premature ovarian failure; I shouldn’t have just used the acronym).

Those gonadotropin levels are high. With a low estrogen, I would wonder about premature ovarian failure

Do we have a prolactin? Elevated Prolactin can increase DHEA-S 


probably low yield but easy test - do we have serum albumin? Since DHEA-S is mostly albumin bound, elevated albumin might explain isolated elevation?

Can anyone make a connection:


 


16 year old with POI:


Menarche 10-11y old with one menses at that time


Next menses at 15y of age


In past year (age 16) had 3 menses (each lasting 5-6 days, normal flow)


LH 37


FSH 44


E2 < 5 pg/mL


AMH < 0.015


21-hydroxylase antibody negative.


 


As part of her initial evaluation of oligomenorrhea, labs for ?pcos were obtained.  She has never had hirsutism.


Dheas levels: 


5/2023 539


12/2023 757


4/2024 >1000


11/2024 914 mcg/dL


 


Adrenal MRI normal


 


Dex-suppressed cortisol normal


 


11/18/24 16:33


17-OH Progesterone Lcms: 12 ng/dl


17-Hydroxypregnenolone: 113 ng/dl


Testosterone, Serum: 19 ng/dL (10-55)


Testost., Free, Calc: 5.1 pg/mL (1.1-6.3)


Testosterone Free Percent: 2.7


Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): 488 (H) ng/dl (39-481)


DHEA-Sulfate (Serum): 914.0 (H) (C) mcg/dl (110-433)


 


One consideration was steroid sulfatase deficiency.  This was particularly a question since she seemed to have no virilization, in spite of such a high DHEAS. 
 But since DHEA is also high, that doesn't seem to fit.  (although dheas is more elevated than dhea).


3BHSD doesn't fit with low 17OHP and 17OHPreg.


 


Anyone have thoughts on the high DHEAS?  Can anyone connect it to the POI?  Can someone connect steroid sulfatase deficiency with POI?


 


(FH is positive for lupus - so i was thinking autoimmune poi, but 21-hydroxylase antibody is negative)

1. I have seen Turner mosaics with normal stature for MPH, diagnosed after normal periods that stopped later on. 
2. Although the patient is unlikely to have 3 beta HSD, You should have measured 17 OHP and 17 Delta 5 P and DHEA early in AM and perform a 60'cosyntropin to be certain, measure both DHEAS and DHEA at 60 min and after dex suppression. It seems you measured the hormones at 4:33 at least that is what is says above.
 We need to teach younger generations to measure adrenal hormones early AM. That saves a lot of time. I recommend at 7-9 AM

Subject: [peds-endo] levothyroxine absorption test
 




This email originated from an EXTERNAL sender to CCHMC. Proceed with caution when replying, opening attachments, or clicking links in this message.




 




Good afternoon! I have a 14 year old male patient with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (diagnosed March 2023) who remains poorly controlled despite progressively increasing levothyroxine doses. He’s only 41.9 kg but is already on 300 mcg daily
 of levothyroxine. Most recent labs on this dose show TSH >100 and free T4 0.51. Labs a month ago (on 275 mcg daily) showed TSH 44.3, free T4 0.9. He is on ferrous sulfate, but mom says they give the levothyroxine in the morning and the iron in the evening.
 Other current medications are lithium (started after diagnosis of Hashimoto’s and levothyroxine initiation), atomoxetine, lamotrigine, montelukast.


 


He’s had one set of completely normal labs (TSH 3.3, free T4 0.95) in January 2024 (on a dose of 125 mcg daily), but other than that TSH has always been elevated, fluctuating between 16 to >100 (with free T4 either low or low normal) despite
 progressively increasing levothyroxine doses. We started off on 50 mcg daily at diagnosis and have just been going up and up. Labs below:


 





 


Basically, I do suspect poor compliance, but I’d like to do a levothyroxine absorption test as family is adamant he is not missing doses. I see the protocols that have been referenced here before recommending doses between 600 to 1000 mcg
 daily. But this adolescent is not adult size (41.9 kg) and so I’m hesitant to use even the 600 mcg dose. I was wondering if it would be worth doing the absorption test but with just his current levothyroxine dose of 300 mcg, which is already a significantly
 higher dose for his size anyway. One protocol I saw (but also for adults) used a 10 mcg/kg dose for the test but it wasn’t clear what the rationale for that was. Or should I just go ahead and do it with the 600 mcg dose? 


 


Thank you for any inputs!

Thanks for sharing this interesting case. The degree of virilisation is modest considering the total high testosterone.
 
Have you checked Testosterone by LCMS?
 
In liver disease there can be increased globulins and the total bound testosterone can be falsely high.
 
I notice the Free Testosterone as low.

 
It might be worth checking serum proteins including globulins.
 
I have seen similar very high Testosterone in a teenager with autoimmune liver disease where LCMS testosterone was normal.

I would people input on what to do with the testosterone overproduction in the patient.

 
Patient is a 7 year old who I saw for concern for premature adrenarche.  She started to have pubic hairs around the age of 6, which increased in amount until May 2024.  On exam she was noted to
 have spare pubic hair, but I also noted mild clitoromegaly.  Her growth had also increased from 50th%tile around 4years, to 80th%tile currently.  MPH of 63.5in.  Given growth spurt and clitoromegaly, labs and bone age were done.

Her labs were concerning for elevated testosterone, elevated androstenedione, NORMAL 17OHP and normal DHEAS.

Therefore a US abdomen/pelvis was done initially was concerning for adrenal mass.

Next step was an MRI abdomen, with referral to surgery and Oncology. 

THE MRI was QUITE surprising:

1.  Congenital absence of the portal vein with extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (type I Abernethy malformation).
2.  Multiple hepatic masses are indeterminate and incompletely characterized on this study without use of a hepatocyte specific contrast agent (eg. Eovist) and may represent focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesions, dysplastic nodules, adenomas, and/or fibrolamellar
 or hepatocellular carcinoma in the context of an Abernethy malformation. 
On MRI her ovaries are described as having multiple follicles and look ‘pubertal’.  While NO breast budding was noted on exam: I have an LH and estradiol pending.

 
The finding of elevated testosterone and androstenedione have been reports in “Premature Pubarche, Hyperinsulinemia and Hypothyroxinemia:
 Novel Manifestations of Congenital Portosystemic Shunts (Abernethy Malformation) in Children”. 

At this moment in time, there is no plan for treatment of liver findings. 

 
My biggest question is would you recommended treating her high testosterone and androstenedione? If so with what?

Would you recommend a trial of bicalutamide?

Most of the medications use to treat hyperandrogenism are metabolized thru the liver and I would hesitate to use these.

Am I missing something else I should be looking at?

thank you for the reply.  

 
I can certainly get a testosterone by LCMS. Prior to my requesting this level; would it change treatment or diagnosis options? 

 
Another interesting factor is that her ovaries ‘look pubertal and stimulated on MRI and US” but LH by ECL is 0.013 mIU/mL, FSH <1 and estradiol by LCMS is 4.4pg/mL. 

AFP I s2.2.  
 
I did get a CMP which should slight AST and ALT elevated at 49 and 43 respectively.  Her serum protein levels was 6.7, albumin 4.3. 

 
If LCMS testosterone is normal… what would explain the clitoromegaly, rapid growth and advancement in bone age?

Hi Christel
 
Thanks for sharing this interesting case. The degree of virilisation is modest considering the total high testosterone.
 
Have you checked Testosterone by LCMS?
 
In liver disease there can be increased globulins and the total bound testosterone can be falsely high.
 
I notice the Free Testosterone as low.

 
It might be worth checking serum proteins including globulins.
 
I have seen similar very high Testosterone in a teenager with autoimmune liver disease where LCMS testosterone was normal.

I would people input on what to do with the testosterone overproduction in the patient.

 
Patient is a 7 year old who I saw for concern for premature adrenarche.  She started to have pubic hairs around the age of 6, which increased in amount until May 2024.  On exam she was noted to have spare
 pubic hair, but I also noted mild clitoromegaly.  Her growth had also increased from 50th%tile around 4years, to 80th%tile currently.  MPH of 63.5in.  Given growth spurt and clitoromegaly, labs and bone age were done.

Her labs were concerning for elevated testosterone, elevated androstenedione, NORMAL 17OHP and normal DHEAS.

Therefore a US abdomen/pelvis was done initially was concerning for adrenal mass.

Next step was an MRI abdomen, with referral to surgery and Oncology. 

THE MRI was QUITE surprising:

1.  Congenital absence of the portal vein with extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (type I Abernethy malformation).
2.  Multiple hepatic masses are indeterminate and incompletely characterized on this study without use of a hepatocyte specific contrast agent (eg. Eovist) and may represent focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesions, dysplastic nodules, adenomas, and/or fibrolamellar
 or hepatocellular carcinoma in the context of an Abernethy malformation. 

On MRI her ovaries are described as having multiple follicles and look ‘pubertal’.  While NO breast budding was noted on exam: I have an LH and estradiol pending.

 
The finding of elevated testosterone and androstenedione have been reports in “Premature Pubarche, Hyperinsulinemia and Hypothyroxinemia: Novel Manifestations
 of Congenital Portosystemic Shunts (Abernethy Malformation) in Children”.  

At this moment in time, there is no plan for treatment of liver findings. 

 
My biggest question is would you recommended treating her high testosterone and androstenedione? If so with what?

Would you recommend a trial of bicalutamide?

Most of the medications use to treat hyperandrogenism are metabolized thru the liver and I would hesitate to use these.

Am I missing something else I should be looking at?

Thank you for providing more information.
 
If LCMS Testosterone or salivary testosterone is normal, then you can stop worrying about source of T and conclude that it was raised total protein
 bound T and does not need treatment or further investigation.
 
The clitoromegaly examination can be subjective. I often find myself doubting appearance of slightly enlarged clitoris (I am not suggesting that
 there is not clitoromegaly).
 
Rapid growth and advanced bone age can be explained by adrenarche.
 
Difficult to explain ovarian appearance when gonadotrophins are low.
 
Is there any skin pigmentation to suggest MAS?
 
You may wish to check DHEAS also by LCMS.
 
I would be interested in your thoughts and further work up.
 
Many thanks

Hi Zoe

We have successfully weaned several kids off hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone after mitotane treatment for ACC. 

 
The one I remember most clearly was on mitotane for about a year and it took 7 months to establish adrenal recovery.  I can’t recall anyone that we were able to wean off after that many years of adrenal hormone
 replacement, but I’m interested to hear the experience of others.

Subject: [peds-endo] Adrenal recovery after treatment with mitotane?
 
Caution: External Sender. Do not open unless you know the content is safe.
 


Hello all,


I would greatly appreciate any insights or experiences regarding adrenal recovery following treatment with mitotane. I am caring for an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with left cortical adenocarcinoma at age
 2. Her treatment included a left adrenalectomy, chemotherapy (cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitotane), and approximately 16 months of mitotane therapy, which was discontinued six years ago. She has since been maintained on physiologic doses of hydrocortisone
 (~8 mg/m²/day) without any other medications. She is otherwise doing very well, with appropriate growth and development.


My primary question is whether adrenal function might recover after being off mitotane for several years. Adult studies have reported recovery of adrenal function following mitotane treatment for ACC. Additionally,
 the recently published international clinical practice guideline for pediatric patients treated with mitotane for ACC notes:



""Most of the patients require glucocorticoid replacement using hydrocortisone/cortisone acetate and less frequently mineralocorticoid replacement shortly after beginning. However, after termination of mitotane,
 it is reversible in the majority of patients.""  (Riedmeier, M., et al. (2024). International consensus on mitotane treatment in pediatric patients with adrenal cortical tumors: Indications, therapy, and management of adverse effects.
European Journal of Endocrinology, 190(4), G15–G24. 
https://doi.org/10.1093/ejendo/lvae038)



Has anyone successfully weaned a patient off hydrocortisone after mitotane treatment? If so, how long did it take for the HPA axis to recover? Any guidance or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!


Thank you for your help!

Hi, 

I'm seeking a second opinion on a patient with PAI that has been really challenging in terms of symptom management. 


This may be a phone call or maybe even having my patient seen at another center if insurance coverage can be obtained.


Any recommendations regarding someone who has a special interest in this area?

* External Email - Caution *


Hi, 

I'm seeking a second opinion on a patient with PAI that has been really challenging in terms of symptom management. 


This may be a phone call or maybe even having my patient seen at another center if insurance coverage can be obtained.


Any recommendations regarding someone who has a special interest in this area?


Thanks for your help,

Santosh,
 
It depends somewhat on his age but in general some sort of glucose monitoring should be done every 3 months if he is under 3 years of age, ever 6 months if 3-9 years, and annually if over 9 years.
 Since you are considering teplizumab I presume he is at least 8 years of age? 

 
I would personally have a patient like this wear a CGM and get an A1c in 3 months. Below are the guidance from our recent consensus statement.

 
Where was this kid picked up with antibodies? TrialNet? ASK? Elsewhere?  What was his initial A1c ? Follow up in TrialNet would also offer additional risk information if they are interested.

I recently screened a boy referred to the pediatric endocrine clinic for an elevated HbA1c and he had positive ZnT8 and GAD 65 antibodies. His repeat HbA1c was normal and his fasting glucose was normal. I did an OGTT and his fasting glucose
 was normal (96 mg/dl) and his 2 hour glucose was 134 mg/dl. 

Does anyone know how long it would be prudent to wait until I do another OGTT? I would like to treat him with Teplizumab to delay the onset of symptoms, and I want to catch him when he has stage 2 type 1 diabetes.

As Alan notes, perhaps the most tangible benefit of close follow up / monitoring is avoidance of DKA at diagnosis. 


Another reason to consider enrolling in the TrialNet Natural History study is that there are other prevention studies coming for Stage 1 and Stage 2 patients. Being followed in TrialNet will give them the opportunity to learn of those opportunities.


Last, it would be helpful (to me) to understand why the family declined teplizumab? As we try to develop  immunotherapeutic strategies for Stage 1 and 2 patients, the decision making of potential subjects is critical to our developing approaches that are
 acceptable to affected families.


All the best,

Yes - that would be most straight forward.




Get referral letter from yourself with all up to date medical details and they can show this to new GP in Auckland who can arrange follow up with the starship Diabetes team.

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

 

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.
 However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.




The genetic team thinks she has ""an underlying endocrine disorder"" as BG should have normalized with cornstarch if there is a true metabolic disorder. A hypoglycemia genetic panel was sent and is pending.

 

Any ideas?







Thank you !

My working diagnosis is actually some sort of ketone processing defect and I was thinking of MCT-1 mutation. Your suggestion is quite plausible and seems fitting aside from she does not have hepatomegaly on exam (ultrasound was ordered though, to be completed)

Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

 

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.
 However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.




The genetic team thinks she has ""an underlying endocrine disorder"" as BG should have normalized with cornstarch if there is a true metabolic disorder. A hypoglycemia genetic panel was sent and is pending.

 

Any ideas?

Hi Abdullah
Thank you for sharing this interesting case .
This child has elevated free fatty acids but low beta hydroxybutyrate  suggesting a possible disorder of ketone generation. We had a similar case that turned out to be due to HMGCoA synthase deficiency
 (confirmed through next generation sequencing). Urine organic acid profile  , like in your case, was not sent because of a lab goof up. If it had,  it would have revealed elevated levels of 4-HMP helping with earlier diagnosis

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.
 However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.




The genetic team thinks she has ""an underlying endocrine disorder"" as BG should have normalized with cornstarch if there is a true metabolic disorder. A hypoglycemia genetic panel was sent and is pending.

 

Any ideas?

Hi Abdullah
Thank you for sharing this interesting case .
This child has elevated free fatty acids but low beta hydroxybutyrate  suggesting a possible disorder of ketone generation. We had a similar case that turned out to be due to HMGCoA synthase deficiency
 (confirmed through next generation sequencing). Urine organic acid profile  , like in your case, was not sent because of a lab goof up. If it had,  it would have revealed elevated levels of 4-HMP helping with earlier diagnosis

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

No MRI was performed as her cortisol response to cosyntropin was robust, and her normal free T4 level rules out central hypothyroidism. She has normal sodium levels and no CNS signs, including nystagmus. Hypoglycemia was not present at birth, and there was
 no conjugated hyperbilirubinemia to suggest giant cell hepatitis. Additionally, there has been no weight loss. These factors collectively make adrenal insufficiency less likely.

If there are still concerns, do you think imaging would contribute to the diagnosis, or would it be more appropriate to repeat another ACTH stimulation test?

 adrenals for the zona glomerulosa to respond to cosyntropin. Has an MRI of the pituitary been done?

 adrenals for the zona glomerulosa to respond to cosyntropin. Has an MRI of the pituitary been done?

Hi Abdullah
Thank you for sharing this interesting case .
This child has elevated free fatty acids but low beta hydroxybutyrate  suggesting a possible disorder of ketone generation. We had a similar case that turned out to be due to HMGCoA synthase deficiency
 (confirmed through next generation sequencing). Urine organic acid profile  , like in your case, was not sent because of a lab goof up. If it had,  it would have revealed elevated levels of 4-HMP helping with earlier diagnosis

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

 

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.
 However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.




The genetic team thinks she has ""an underlying endocrine disorder"" as BG should have normalized with cornstarch if there is a true metabolic disorder. A hypoglycemia genetic panel was sent and is pending.

 

Any ideas?







Thank you !

-No testing for reducing substances was performed. 


- Blood gas and lactate levels were normal, and ketones were negative when blood glucose was within the normal range. 


- During the fasting challenge, the initial blood glucose was 3.4 mmol/L, remained between 3.2–3.9 mmol/L, and dropped to 2.5 mmol/L after 11 hours.
 
- The patient is being exclusively fed Nutramigen.


- I agree that ketotic hypoglycemia fits the clinical picture, but the amount of cornstarch being used—5 grams/kg/day—is significantly higher than what I typically use in cases of ""idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia"".


- by the way, the GH cut off in our assay is 5.7 which is what we use for GH stimulation test. As such I concluded the GH of 8 is robust

I guess the question is whether the alk phos elevation is from bone and if this is meaningful. I have a few FHH patients who have mildly elevated alk phos level with PTH that is at the upper end of the reference
 range and lowish serum phos; the TmP/GFR is mildly depressed. No signs on PE or x rays of rickets. I have tried cinacalcet plus some PhosNaK in these kids with success in raising the serum phos and lowering the alk phos. I’m not a fan of PTX in these otherwise
 asymptomatic kids. 
 
If you kiddo is not growing well I would look more closely at whether this could be related to growth plate disturbance due to lowish serum phos.  MRI of the knees (with diffusion tensor imaging if possible)
 if far more sensitive than plain film x rays at showing growth plate disturbance in hypophosphatemic rickets; something to consider.

 
Of course there are many other reasons for short stature…

You don't often get email from

Learn why this is important 










This reply is long overdue but I wanted to close the loop about a case I presented on 6/19/2024 re hypercalcemia.


 


As a brief reminder:  8 y/o prev healthy and asymptomatic male who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia (~13 mg/dL corrected
 for albumin), hypermagnesemia (3.1 mg/dL), with inappropriately normal PTH (34 pg/mL), alk phos elevation (385 U/L), phos 4.1 mg/dL normal 25(OH)D 27 ng/mL.  Dr. Levine got the prize for the only person to respond and favored FHH as the most likely
 diagnosis. 


 


Since the initial email:


 


1. More prodding for family history which included having parents to talk to their parents/family revealed: mother has normal Ca (prenatal labs), father has not had any known lab work/hasn't done any/feels he is healthy and well; but, paternal
 grandfather had ""calcium issues"" and reportedly may have had at least a partial parathyroidectomy.


2. Urine Ca/Cr was normal (0.11 mass ratio)


3. FeCa 0.45%


4. Genetic testing (proband only) revealed: a variant in 
CASR c.461C>A (p.Ala154Glu), classified as a VUS, but predicted to be a disruptive missense variant. Family has unfortunately not followed up so I haven't been able to try to get his parents tested.


 


So, I'm left to conclude this most likely is FHH.  As always, I welcome any additional thoughts.

If patient is truly asymptomatic I would favor FHH as diagnosis, as the PTH is a bit low for other forms of PHPT and not at all suppressed as it would be in PTH-independent hypercalcemia.

I follow three patients who have R185Q dominant negative CASR variant, some of whom had NSHPT as newborns. After age 1 year they typically have labs similar to this patient (including
 lowish serum phos and slightly high alk phos) and are asymptomatic. One of the kids has poor growth, but probably unrelated to the CASR variant. Others grow well.

 
I must say that I would be reluctant to admit an asymptomatic kid like this for hyperhydration. I would probably keep him in my clinic pushing oral fluids until I could get a urine
 for calcium and creatinine (I can be very persuasive) and if the FeCa was less than 1% I would feel very comfortable not admitting. All of the kids we have seen with PHPT had elevated urine calcium levels and much higher serum PTH levels. I would rush some
 genetics on the kiddo. and I would check parents serum calcium level. In all the cases I have seen in which R185Q caused NSHPT the father was the carrier or it was de novo. As this kiddo has no history of NSHPT I would guess that the mother has the CASR variant
 as well. In many of the FHH families I have seen most affected relatives of the proband were unaware that they had hypercalcemia, often because they never had their serum calcium checked or the hypercalcemia was mild and their physician did not say anything
 (or doctor missed it…it happens!). Given that most parents can access their medical records (including labs) on their smartphone in clinic, I ask them to check while I examine the kiddo. so I don’t put much stock in a negative history.  
 
Cinacalcet can bring the serum calcium down.

I have an interesting case of an 8 year-old male who presented for short stature but on further work up was incidentally noted to have hypercalcemia. No stigmata of Williams syndrome.
 He is an otherwise healthy male without any significant medical issues or complaints, he was not on any supplements except Pediasure once or twice daily for low weight concerns.

 


He initially presented to me about a month ago for height -2.7 SDS. Weight was -3.4 SDS, BMI 2nd percentile/-2 SDS. On routine work up: 


 


April 2024 (pertinent labs only):


Total serum Ca 13 mg/dL (albumin 4.6 g/dL) - yikes!


BUN 24/Cr 0.54 - renal function acceptable


phos 3.5 mg/dL - low for age, PTH should be elevated but alas it was not ordered as there was no known concern for hyperCa


alk phos: 391 U/L


TSH 0.9 mIU/L, Free T4 0.8 ng/dL


Normal CBC (no blasts)


Bicarb 24 - no alkalosis


 


Follow up work up to evaluate hypercalcemia ordered but was not completed until a few days ago:


 


June 2024


Total serum Ca 13.7 mg/dL (albumin 4.7 g/dL, corrected Ca for albumin 4 13.1 mg/dL) - yikes!!



BUN 14/Cr 0.45  - rules out CKD


phos 4.1 mg/dL - lower limit of normal for age 


alk phos: 385 U/L - certainly has increased bone turnover


PTH 34 pg/mL (14-85)  - inappropriately normal?


Magnesium 3.1 mg/dL - whoa?



25(OH)D 27 ng/mL - okay


1,25 (OH)2 33 pg/mL (31-87) - okay? should be lower?


8 am cortisol 19.9 mcg/dL - AI ruled out


bicarb 20 


 


Pending: Vitamin A, PTHrP, urine studies (he was not able to urinate at the time of the labs).


The pt is now admitted for hyperhydration with isotonic fluid and further work up (including the urine studies!). 


 


There is no known family history of hypercalcemia (keeping familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in mind - but would that present with a total Ca of 13.7 mg/dL?). Categorically denies
 any vitamin/Tums/etc supplementation.


 


TL;DR / in summary:


 


8 y/o otherwise healthy and asymptomatic boy who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia with inappropriately normal
 PTH, alk phos elevation. Etiologies that have been ruled out: renal insufficiency, vitamin D toxicosis, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency. 


 


Etiologies: parathyroid adenoma (a bit young? would PTH be higher?) vs MEN1 vs. Malignancy (best next test?) vs FHH vs CYP24A1 variant vs ?


 


Any guidance/advice/comments are greatly appreciated.


 


Thanks!

109523129,Abdullah Almaghraby,"Nov 11, 2024 8:03pm","Hello, 




This patient appears to have a compound heterozygous mutation in the ALMS1 gene, with two AA substitutions at separate locations, which may impact the function of the ALMS1 protein. Given the noted phenotype (severe early obesity), these mutations likely affect
 the gene function negatively. 




A referral to genetics is needed.  At this age, lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of treatment, and a dietician, perhaps at SickKids metabolic and genetic department, can support the family with management strategies. Setmelanotide (MC4R agonist)
 has shown limited efficacy in Alström syndrome (though effective in Bardet-Biedl syndrome). Also, referring to genetics will likely facilitate hearing and ophthalmology assessment in addition to parental testing and genetic counselling. 




Cheers,

Good afternoon! 
I recently have been following a 9 month old male for obesity. He was born 39 weeks repeat C section at 3.45 kg and had consistently increasing percentiles to above the 99.9th percentile and is currently 14.15 kg (~31 pounds) and length is at the 90th
 percentile at 9.5 months old. (growth chart attached is from the PCP). No history of obesity in the family. He is exclusively breastfeeding 5 times per day for 30 minutes with little to no intake of solids. Mother reported rarely breastfeeding overnight but
 then after further discussion she reported using breastfeeding to soothe the child many times per day and at night. On physical exam he had no shortened metacarpals or subcutaneous nodules, he had 2 cafe au lait macules (one 4x5cm and the other 1cm x0.5cm). 
 Testes were retractile but palpable. Phallus was 4cm with large suprapubic fat. He also has gross motor delay and is not crawling or pulling to stand but able to sit unassisted. 
 

 
He had some non fasting labs done which revealed an A1c of 5.8%, normal electrolytes, calcium, PTH, TSH and Free T4. Vitamin D was 52nmol/L (20.8 ng/ml). He had microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.1. Total cholesterol was  2.57 mmol/L (99.4 mg/dl).
 Triglycerides 1.98 mmol/L (175 mg/dl) . HDL 0.71 mmol/L (27.4mg/dl) and LDL 0.96 mmol/L (37 mg/dl)
 
I sent the prevention genetics rare obesity panel which returned positive for 2 heterozygous mutations in the ALMS1 gene of uncertain significance.  (Pathogenic variants in ALMS1 cause autosomal recessive Alstrom syndrome OMIM #203800, characterized by
 progressive cone-rod dystrophy, hearing loss, childhood obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus Paisey et al. 2019. PubMed ID 20301444). 

 
I have recently graduated fellowship and have not come across this syndrome before and wanted to reach out to the group for any advice for any next steps I should take for further management. I think it would be beneficial for the parents to get tested
 as well which would be free through the company. I appreciate any advice or comments.

I would like to get your thoughts on this:
 
7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile 
 at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS.  Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high. 

Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

In girls with CPP, the LH response to GnRH stimulation may remain low (< 5 IU/L) until mid-puberty, often up to early Tanner stage 3, with a low LH-to-FSH ratio. In these cases, CPP can be confirmed by measuring pubertal levels of estradiol 20–24 hours after

 [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]

 

 

Whether it would be quickly or slowly progressive and needs to be treated would be based on clinical judgement based on lack of breast development

I would like to get your thoughts on this:

 

7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile  at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile
 at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.

She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS.  Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high. 

Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.

Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

Clearly , she has a pre-pubertal response but how do I explain the estradiol level.

I am planning to get pelvic ultrasound which was not done during the initial investigation.

I was thinking about McCUne Albright syndrome but don’t we expect lower LH and FSH than these or is that should still be considered?

I’m
 writing about a current case that I’m following:


The
 patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother
 had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet.
 There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.


Initial
 labs from that visit:
LH
 = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH
 = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol
 = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin
 = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS
 = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone
 = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone
 = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione
 = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She
 had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”


A
 high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24:
 ACTH Stim test results:
Pre
 => Post
17OHPregnenolone:
 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone:
 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol:
 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA:
 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione:
 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone:
 <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol:
 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone:
 21 => 21 ng/dL


Mild
 elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had
 a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 


Labs
 were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24:
 HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP
 and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH
 = 1.1
LH
 = <0.2
TSH
 = 3.26
Estradiol
 = <15
Midnight
 salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)


10/6/24:
 Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary
 Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)


10/25/24:
 Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any
 recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? 
 
Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient. It’s pretty fun when we actually find the zebras!

I’m writing about a current case that I’m following:

The patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet. There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.

Initial labs from that visit:
LH = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”

A high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24: ACTH Stim test results:
Pre => Post
17OHPregnenolone: 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone: 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol: 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA: 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione: 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone: <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol: 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone: 21 => 21 ng/dL

Mild elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 

Labs were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24: HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH = 1.1
LH = <0.2
TSH = 3.26
Estradiol = <15
Midnight salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)

10/6/24: Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)

10/25/24: Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? 
 
Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient. It’s pretty fun when we actually find the zebras!
Best,
Josh

I would like to get your thoughts on this:
 
7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually
 increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile  at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS. 
Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high.  
Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement
 , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

Good afternoon colleagues, 
 
I am seeing a 10 yo male tomorrow with a PMH of craniopharyngioma, now s/p resection by neurosurgery, resulting in the transection of the pituitary gland with subsequent panhypopituitarism w/o thirst mechanism. My colleague
 alerted me to some unusual inquiries regarding certain hormone replacements. In particular, BID growth hormone dosing for growth hormone deficiency and FSH/HCG injections for future puberty. Personally, I’ve never dosed growth hormone twice daily and I’ve
 never used FSH/HCG injections to induce puberty so I’m just curious if anyone does this clinically (or if this question has been posed to you) and how it might differ from what I typically do, which is once daily growth hormone injection and testosterone injections.

 
Thank you ahead of time for your thoughts!

Subject: [peds-endo] treatment of tall stature in Weaver Syndrome
 


Dear colleagues

I want to know your opinion about the following case: 

A 8.1 yo girl with Weaver Syndrome (clinical diagnosis plus VUS on EZH2), moderate mental delay, prepuberal. Height 149.6 cm (Z 4.1), weight 34.4 kg (Z 1.91). Bone age 8y10m (G&P). Predicted height (B&P) 200.5 cm. 

Parents are very concerned about actual and final height. 

Are estrogens an accepted therapy in these extremely tall girls? 




Thank you in advance

Subject: [peds-endo] SEMA3A mutation

Hi,

 


I was wondering if anyone has experience with SEMA3A mutations.  I have a now 16 year old female I have been following for GHD and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Brain MRI was normal. I just got genetic testing
 that showed two variants of uncertain significance - both heterozygous findings.   One mutation in CCDC141 and another in SEMA3A.  In reading, it looks like SEMA3A can cause Auto Dom IHH but the mutation she has is not yet clear if
 causative.   In speaking more with family after these results, the girl is now having more dental issues - four adult teeth that are missing and poor enamel in all teeth that may require significant treatment in future.   


 


I am going to test parents to see if they have the mutation.   


 


Does anyone have experience with this mutation?


 


Thank you!

I have seen at least one patient with a rare nonsense variant in SEMA3A, and one with a rare missense variant, both heterozygous, and both variants were present in an unaffected parent (suggesting that it’s
 not always autosomal dominant, if these variants were causative).  Neither had hypodontia. 

 
So, while SEMA3A is at this point a pretty well-established IHH gene, this is a great example of how complex IHH genetics is.  You’d have to look at more details about the variant itself to be able to comment
 further on whether it’s causative, but this was presumably taken into account in the determination of “unknown significance” in the report. 

 
I would not discount the possibility that the variant in CCDC141 is contributing as well in an oligogenic fashion, especially since other families have been described that have rare heterozygous variants in
 this gene PLUS heterozygous variants in additional IHH-associated that segregate appropriately with the IHH phenotype (e.g.
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-3391). 

 
Your best bet is to test the parents, as you are planning, but I would suggest testing them for both variants. 

 
Hope this helps!

 bicalutamide is just as effective as spironolactone. However, I prefer spironolactone due to the risk of hepatotoxicity with bicalutamide.
 
If you decide to use spironolactone, it is important to regularly adjust the dose based on weight: 5.7 mg/kg/day divided into two
 equal doses separated by ~12 hours. It’s also important for the parents to hold spironolactone during gastrointestinal illnesses. Also, parents should encourage sodium intake and limit potassium-rich foods.
 
I wouldn’t be surprised if the father was one of our past FMPP patients at the NIH!

You are most likely dealing the same old problem. You don’t have to prove it, just switch HCG to depo-testosterone and check the peak and trough serum testosterone level after giving him the first injection
 by your nurse to prove new treatment will work well for him. You can change the daily GH injection to a weekly one and ask your patient’s father to “help” every weekly injection at least for the first month before you check his IGF-1 level to prove the new
 GH therapy works very well for him as well.

I have a 17 y.o. male patient with history of craniopharyngioma initially diagnosed at age 7 who has had multiple surgical procedures, including VP shunt placement, and radiation treatment.  He
 had a recurrence in May 2022 and underwent surgical debulking without additional radiation.  His recent MRI's have been stable.


 


He has panhypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Current medications are:


 


 Genotropin (12 mg pen) 3.2 mg SQ 6 times per week (0.312 mg/kg/week)


 Levothyroxine 88 mcg PO daily


 Hydrocortisone 5 mg PO TID (9.0 mg/m2/day based on BSA of 1.67 m2)


 DDAVP 0.2 mg PO in AM and 0.1 mg PO in PM


 hCG 500 units SQ on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays


 


In August 2023, he had demonstrated good responses to both the growth hormone and hCG with IGF-1 173 ng/mL and trough testosterone level on Wednesday morning prior to that day's injection of 473
 ng/dL.


 


At the last two assessments in January 2024 and October 2024, his IGF-1 levels have been 22 and 25 ng/mL, respectively, and both testosterone levels were 1 ng/dL.


 


His most recent free T4 is in the middle of the reference interval and his serum sodium and serum osmolality are normal.


 


Father has been more attentive to the injections (which the patient does himself) and feels confident that the patient is giving them properly.


 


Is there anything that would explain the low IGF-1 and testosterone values other than non-adherence with the injections?  We discussed potentially trying to put him on one of the weekly growth
 hormone formulations and possibly switching from hCG to testosterone (either injected or topical).  It would be one thing if he did not have a previous response to these therapies, but there was a definite change in lab values from August 2023 to January 2024.


 


Thanks,


Alex

Santosh,
 
It depends somewhat on his age but in general some sort of glucose monitoring should be done every 3 months if he is under 3 years of age, ever 6 months if 3-9 years, and annually if over 9 years.
 Since you are considering teplizumab I presume he is at least 8 years of age? 

 
I would personally have a patient like this wear a CGM and get an A1c in 3 months. Below are the guidance from our recent consensus statement.

 
Where was this kid picked up with antibodies? TrialNet? ASK? Elsewhere?  What was his initial A1c ? Follow up in TrialNet would also offer additional risk information if they are interested.

I recently screened a boy referred to the pediatric endocrine clinic for an elevated HbA1c and he had positive ZnT8 and GAD 65 antibodies. His repeat HbA1c was normal and his fasting glucose was normal. I did an OGTT and his fasting glucose
 was normal (96 mg/dl) and his 2 hour glucose was 134 mg/dl. 

Does anyone know how long it would be prudent to wait until I do another OGTT? I would like to treat him with Teplizumab to delay the onset of symptoms, and I want to catch him when he has stage 2 type 1 diabetes.


I was thinking of repeating the OGTT in six months.

As Alan notes, perhaps the most tangible benefit of close follow up / monitoring is avoidance of DKA at diagnosis. 


Another reason to consider enrolling in the TrialNet Natural History study is that there are other prevention studies coming for Stage 1 and Stage 2 patients. Being followed in TrialNet will give them the opportunity to learn of those opportunities.


Last, it would be helpful (to me) to understand why the family declined teplizumab? As we try to develop  immunotherapeutic strategies for Stage 1 and 2 patients, the decision making of potential subjects is critical to our developing approaches that are
 acceptable to affected families.


All the best,

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

 

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.
 However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.




The genetic team thinks she has ""an underlying endocrine disorder"" as BG should have normalized with cornstarch if there is a true metabolic disorder. A hypoglycemia genetic panel was sent and is pending.

 

Any ideas?







Thank you !

Hi Abdullah
Thank you for sharing this interesting case .
This child has elevated free fatty acids but low beta hydroxybutyrate  suggesting a possible disorder of ketone generation. We had a similar case that turned out to be due to HMGCoA synthase deficiency
 (confirmed through next generation sequencing). Urine organic acid profile  , like in your case, was not sent because of a lab goof up. If it had,  it would have revealed elevated levels of 4-HMP helping with earlier diagnosis

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

Hi Abdullah
Thank you for sharing this interesting case .
This child has elevated free fatty acids but low beta hydroxybutyrate  suggesting a possible disorder of ketone generation. We had a similar case that turned out to be due to HMGCoA synthase deficiency
 (confirmed through next generation sequencing). Urine organic acid profile  , like in your case, was not sent because of a lab goof up. If it had,  it would have revealed elevated levels of 4-HMP helping with earlier diagnosis

Dear all, 




I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case.  Sorry of the lengthy email !







This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has
hypoglycemia.

She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either.
 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

 

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.

No MRI was performed as her cortisol response to cosyntropin was robust, and her normal free T4 level rules out central hypothyroidism. She has normal sodium levels and no CNS signs, including nystagmus. Hypoglycemia was not present at birth, and there was
 no conjugated hyperbilirubinemia to suggest giant cell hepatitis. Additionally, there has been no weight loss. These factors collectively make adrenal insufficiency less likely.

If there are still concerns, do you think imaging would contribute to the diagnosis, or would it be more appropriate to repeat another ACTH stimulation test?




Thanks again!

 After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked.

She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around
 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food

 

During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol.

 

Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th %

 

However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

 

PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM):  

- Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)

- Insulin: < 5 pmol/L  (< 0.7 mIU/mL)

- Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L  [< 0.25]  (28.5 mg/dL)

- Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0

- Cortisol: 103 nmol/L   (3.7 mcg/dL)

- GH: 8.02 mcg/L

- Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53]

- Plasma amino acid: normal

- Urine organic acid: was not collected

- Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60]

- Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84]

- Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. 

GLUCAGON CHALLENGE:

- 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL)

- 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL)




I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia
 is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained.




21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM]

- Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL)

- ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL)

- Na: 143 [132 - 140]

- K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2]

- Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)

- Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300]

- Lipid profile: normal

- CPK: 237 [33 - 165]




Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH?  but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening)

 

23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg)

- Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL)

- Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL)

 

- TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6]

- FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21]  (1 ng/dL)

 

So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. 




Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch.
 However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.




The genetic team thinks she has ""an underlying endocrine disorder"" as BG should have normalized with cornstarch if there is a true metabolic disorder. A hypoglycemia genetic panel was sent and is pending.

 

Any ideas?

Thanks Alan so much for your feedback




No MRI was performed as her cortisol response to cosyntropin was robust, and her normal free T4 level rules out central hypothyroidism. She has normal sodium levels and no CNS signs, including nystagmus. Hypoglycemia was not present at birth, and there was
 no conjugated hyperbilirubinemia to suggest giant cell hepatitis. Additionally, there has been no weight loss. These factors collectively make adrenal insufficiency less likely.

If there are still concerns, do you think imaging would contribute to the diagnosis, or would it be more appropriate to repeat another ACTH stimulation test?




Thanks again!

I do not think the normal ACTH stim test definitively excluded central adrenal deficiency due to a hypothalamic and or pituitary disorder such as an ectopic posterior pituitary with sufficient autonomous ACTH trophic effect on the
 adrenals for the zona glomerulosa to respond to cosyntropin. Has an MRI of the pituitary been done?

Hi Abdullah
Thank you for sharing this interesting case .
This child has elevated free fatty acids but low beta hydroxybutyrate  suggesting a possible disorder of ketone generation. We had a similar case that turned out to be due to HMGCoA synthase deficiency
 (confirmed through next generation sequencing). Urine organic acid profile  , like in your case, was not sent because of a lab goof up. If it had,  it would have revealed elevated levels of 4-HMP helping with earlier diagnosis

-No testing for reducing substances was performed. 


- Blood gas and lactate levels were normal, and ketones were negative when blood glucose was within the normal range. 


- During the fasting challenge, the initial blood glucose was 3.4 mmol/L, remained between 3.2–3.9 mmol/L, and dropped to 2.5 mmol/L after 11 hours.
 
- The patient is being exclusively fed Nutramigen.


- I agree that ketotic hypoglycemia fits the clinical picture, but the amount of cornstarch being used—5 grams/kg/day—is significantly higher than what I typically use in cases of ""idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia"".


- by the way, the GH cut off in our assay is 5.7 which is what we use for GH stimulation test. As such I concluded the GH of 8 is robust

Franklin). Thus, I think you have the likely diagnosis. Certainly sounds like the paternal side is origin of hypercalcemia/FHH, so getting the father to show his past serum calcium level (hard to believe that he has never had a CMP!) would be helpful, and
 then genotype him!
 
I guess the question is whether the alk phos elevation is from bone and if this is meaningful. I have a few FHH patients who have mildly elevated alk phos level with PTH that is at the upper end of the reference
 range and lowish serum phos; the TmP/GFR is mildly depressed. No signs on PE or x rays of rickets. I have tried cinacalcet plus some PhosNaK in these kids with success in raising the serum phos and lowering the alk phos. I’m not a fan of PTX in these otherwise
 asymptomatic kids. 
 
If you kiddo is not growing well I would look more closely at whether this could be related to growth plate disturbance due to lowish serum phos.  MRI of the knees (with diffusion tensor imaging if possible)
 if far more sensitive than plain film x rays at showing growth plate disturbance in hypophosphatemic rickets; something to consider.

 
Of course there are many other reasons for short stature…

You don't often get email from

Learn why this is important 










This reply is long overdue but I wanted to close the loop about a case I presented on 6/19/2024 re hypercalcemia.


 


As a brief reminder:  8 y/o prev healthy and asymptomatic male who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia (~13 mg/dL corrected
 for albumin), hypermagnesemia (3.1 mg/dL), with inappropriately normal PTH (34 pg/mL), alk phos elevation (385 U/L), phos 4.1 mg/dL normal 25(OH)D 27 ng/mL.  Dr. Levine got the prize for the only person to respond and favored FHH as the most likely
 diagnosis. 


 


Since the initial email:


 


1. More prodding for family history which included having parents to talk to their parents/family revealed: mother has normal Ca (prenatal labs), father has not had any known lab work/hasn't done any/feels he is healthy and well; but, paternal
 grandfather had ""calcium issues"" and reportedly may have had at least a partial parathyroidectomy.


2. Urine Ca/Cr was normal (0.11 mass ratio)


3. FeCa 0.45%


4. Genetic testing (proband only) revealed: a variant in 
CASR c.461C>A (p.Ala154Glu), classified as a VUS, but predicted to be a disruptive missense variant. Family has unfortunately not followed up so I haven't been able to try to get his parents tested.


 


So, I'm left to conclude this most likely is FHH.  As always, I welcome any additional thoughts.

If patient is truly asymptomatic I would favor FHH as diagnosis, as the PTH is a bit low for other forms of PHPT and not at all suppressed as it would be in PTH-independent hypercalcemia.

I follow three patients who have R185Q dominant negative CASR variant, some of whom had NSHPT as newborns. After age 1 year they typically have labs similar to this patient (including
 lowish serum phos and slightly high alk phos) and are asymptomatic. One of the kids has poor growth, but probably unrelated to the CASR variant. Others grow well.

 
I must say that I would be reluctant to admit an asymptomatic kid like this for hyperhydration. I would probably keep him in my clinic pushing oral fluids until I could get a urine
 for calcium and creatinine (I can be very persuasive) and if the FeCa was less than 1% I would feel very comfortable not admitting. All of the kids we have seen with PHPT had elevated urine calcium levels and much higher serum PTH levels. I would rush some
 genetics on the kiddo. and I would check parents serum calcium level. In all the cases I have seen in which R185Q caused NSHPT the father was the carrier or it was de novo. As this kiddo has no history of NSHPT I would guess that the mother has the CASR variant
 as well. In many of the FHH families I have seen most affected relatives of the proband were unaware that they had hypercalcemia, often because they never had their serum calcium checked or the hypercalcemia was mild and their physician did not say anything
 (or doctor missed it…it happens!). Given that most parents can access their medical records (including labs) on their smartphone in clinic, I ask them to check while I examine the kiddo. so I don’t put much stock in a negative history.  
 
Cinacalcet can bring the serum calcium down.

I have an interesting case of an 8 year-old male who presented for short stature but on further work up was incidentally noted to have hypercalcemia. No stigmata of Williams syndrome.
 He is an otherwise healthy male without any significant medical issues or complaints, he was not on any supplements except Pediasure once or twice daily for low weight concerns.

 


He initially presented to me about a month ago for height -2.7 SDS. Weight was -3.4 SDS, BMI 2nd percentile/-2 SDS. On routine work up: 


 


April 2024 (pertinent labs only):


Total serum Ca 13 mg/dL (albumin 4.6 g/dL) - yikes!


BUN 24/Cr 0.54 - renal function acceptable


phos 3.5 mg/dL - low for age, PTH should be elevated but alas it was not ordered as there was no known concern for hyperCa


alk phos: 391 U/L


TSH 0.9 mIU/L, Free T4 0.8 ng/dL


Normal CBC (no blasts)


Bicarb 24 - no alkalosis


 


Follow up work up to evaluate hypercalcemia ordered but was not completed until a few days ago:


 


June 2024


Total serum Ca 13.7 mg/dL (albumin 4.7 g/dL, corrected Ca for albumin 4 13.1 mg/dL) - yikes!!



BUN 14/Cr 0.45  - rules out CKD


phos 4.1 mg/dL - lower limit of normal for age 


alk phos: 385 U/L - certainly has increased bone turnover


PTH 34 pg/mL (14-85)  - inappropriately normal?


Magnesium 3.1 mg/dL - whoa?



25(OH)D 27 ng/mL - okay


1,25 (OH)2 33 pg/mL (31-87) - okay? should be lower?


8 am cortisol 19.9 mcg/dL - AI ruled out


bicarb 20 


 


Pending: Vitamin A, PTHrP, urine studies (he was not able to urinate at the time of the labs).


The pt is now admitted for hyperhydration with isotonic fluid and further work up (including the urine studies!). 


 


There is no known family history of hypercalcemia (keeping familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in mind - but would that present with a total Ca of 13.7 mg/dL?). Categorically denies
 any vitamin/Tums/etc supplementation.


 


TL;DR / in summary:


 


8 y/o otherwise healthy and asymptomatic boy who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia with inappropriately normal
 PTH, alk phos elevation. Etiologies that have been ruled out: renal insufficiency, vitamin D toxicosis, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency. 


 


Etiologies: parathyroid adenoma (a bit young? would PTH be higher?) vs MEN1 vs. Malignancy (best next test?) vs FHH vs CYP24A1 variant vs ?


 


Any guidance/advice/comments are greatly appreciated.


 


Thanks!

109523129,Abdullah Almaghraby,"Nov 11, 2024 8:03pm","Hello, 




This patient appears to have a compound heterozygous mutation in the ALMS1 gene, with two AA substitutions at separate locations, which may impact the function of the ALMS1 protein. Given the noted phenotype (severe early obesity), these mutations likely affect
 the gene function negatively. 




A referral to genetics is needed.  At this age, lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of treatment, and a dietician, perhaps at SickKids metabolic and genetic department, can support the family with management strategies. Setmelanotide (MC4R agonist)
 has shown limited efficacy in Alström syndrome (though effective in Bardet-Biedl syndrome). Also, referring to genetics will likely facilitate hearing and ophthalmology assessment in addition to parental testing and genetic counselling.

Good afternoon! 
I recently have been following a 9 month old male for obesity. He was born 39 weeks repeat C section at 3.45 kg and had consistently increasing percentiles to above the 99.9th percentile and is currently 14.15 kg (~31 pounds) and length is at the 90th
 percentile at 9.5 months old. (growth chart attached is from the PCP). No history of obesity in the family. He is exclusively breastfeeding 5 times per day for 30 minutes with little to no intake of solids. Mother reported rarely breastfeeding overnight but
 then after further discussion she reported using breastfeeding to soothe the child many times per day and at night. On physical exam he had no shortened metacarpals or subcutaneous nodules, he had 2 cafe au lait macules (one 4x5cm and the other 1cm x0.5cm). 
 Testes were retractile but palpable. Phallus was 4cm with large suprapubic fat. He also has gross motor delay and is not crawling or pulling to stand but able to sit unassisted. 
 

 
He had some non fasting labs done which revealed an A1c of 5.8%, normal electrolytes, calcium, PTH, TSH and Free T4. Vitamin D was 52nmol/L (20.8 ng/ml). He had microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.1. Total cholesterol was  2.57 mmol/L (99.4 mg/dl).
 Triglycerides 1.98 mmol/L (175 mg/dl) . HDL 0.71 mmol/L (27.4mg/dl) and LDL 0.96 mmol/L (37 mg/dl)
 
I sent the prevention genetics rare obesity panel which returned positive for 2 heterozygous mutations in the ALMS1 gene of uncertain significance.  (Pathogenic variants in ALMS1 cause autosomal recessive Alstrom syndrome OMIM #203800, characterized by
 progressive cone-rod dystrophy, hearing loss, childhood obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus Paisey et al. 2019. PubMed ID 20301444). 

 
I have recently graduated fellowship and have not come across this syndrome before and wanted to reach out to the group for any advice for any next steps I should take for further management. I think it would be beneficial for the parents to get tested
 as well which would be free through the company. I appreciate any advice or comments.

7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile 
 at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS.  Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high. 

Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

I believe that this is actually a pubertal response
 
As Leuprolide and other GnRHa, have  more ‘on-time” on the GnRH receptor than native GnRH, the 24 hour sex steroid level is frequently informative and c/w true central puberty
 
See paper
 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8473395/

Whether it would be quickly or slowly progressive and needs to be treated would be based on clinical judgement based on lack of breast development

I would like to get your thoughts on this:
 
7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile 
 at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS.  
Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high.  
Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

Fair enough, but wouldn't you be very suspicious of a diagnosis of CPP when there is no breast development?

Hello, 




In girls with CPP, the LH response to GnRH stimulation may remain low (< 5 IU/L) until mid-puberty, often up to early Tanner stage 3, with a low LH-to-FSH ratio. In these cases, CPP can be confirmed by measuring pubertal levels of estradiol 20–24 hours after
 stimulation with leuprolide. Please see attached papers. 




Thanks,

Abdullah

I’m
 writing about a current case that I’m following:


The
 patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother
 had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet.
 There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.


Initial
 labs from that visit:
LH
 = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH
 = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol
 = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin
 = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS
 = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone
 = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone
 = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione
 = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She
 had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”


A
 high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24:
 ACTH Stim test results:
Pre
 => Post
17OHPregnenolone:
 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone:
 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol:
 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA:
 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione:
 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone:
 <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol:
 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone:
 21 => 21 ng/dL


Mild
 elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had
 a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 


Labs
 were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24:
 HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP
 and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH
 = 1.1
LH
 = <0.2
TSH
 = 3.26
Estradiol
 = <15
Midnight
 salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)


10/6/24:
 Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary
 Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)


10/25/24:
 Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any
 recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? 
 
Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient. It’s pretty fun when we actually find the zebras!
Best,
Josh

Subject: [External][peds-endo] [case] Cushing Syndrome....no really...I think I found one!
 

I’m writing about a current case that I’m following:
 
The patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and
 her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago.
 She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet. There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner
 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.
 
Initial labs from that visit:
LH = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”
 
A high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24: ACTH Stim test results:
Pre => Post
17OHPregnenolone: 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone: 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol: 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA: 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione: 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone: <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol: 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone: 21 => 21 ng/dL
 
Mild elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained
 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 
 
Labs were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24: HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH = 1.1
LH = <0.2
TSH = 3.26
Estradiol = <15
Midnight salivary cortisol =
0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)
 
10/6/24: Midnight Salivary Cortisol =
0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary Free Cortisol =
129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)
 
10/25/24: Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm.

I would like to get your thoughts on this:
 
7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually
 increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile  at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS. 
Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high.  
Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement
 , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

Subject: [peds-endo] Panhypopituitarism secondary to craniopharyngioma resection
 








You don't often get email from

Learn why this is important









Good afternoon colleagues, 
 
I am seeing a 10 yo male tomorrow with a PMH of craniopharyngioma, now s/p resection by neurosurgery, resulting in the transection of the pituitary gland with subsequent panhypopituitarism w/o thirst mechanism. My colleague
 alerted me to some unusual inquiries regarding certain hormone replacements. In particular, BID growth hormone dosing for growth hormone deficiency and FSH/HCG injections for future puberty. Personally, I’ve never dosed growth hormone twice daily and I’ve
 never used FSH/HCG injections to induce puberty so I’m just curious if anyone does this clinically (or if this question has been posed to you) and how it might differ from what I typically do, which is once daily growth hormone injection and testosterone injections.

 
Thank you ahead of time for your thoughts!
 
Best,
 
Priya S. Srivastava

Learn why this is important 








Good afternoon colleagues,

 
I am seeing a 10 yo male tomorrow with a PMH of craniopharyngioma, now s/p resection by neurosurgery, resulting in the transection of the pituitary gland with subsequent panhypopituitarism
 w/o thirst mechanism. My colleague alerted me to some unusual inquiries regarding certain hormone replacements. In particular, BID growth hormone dosing for growth hormone deficiency and FSH/HCG injections for future puberty. Personally, I’ve never dosed growth
 hormone twice daily and I’ve never used FSH/HCG injections to induce puberty so I’m just curious if anyone does this clinically (or if this question has been posed to you) and how it might differ from what I typically do, which is once daily growth hormone
 injection and testosterone injections. 
 
Thank you ahead of time for your thoughts!
 
Best,

Subject: [peds-endo] SEMA3A mutation

Hi,

 


I was wondering if anyone has experience with SEMA3A mutations.  I have a now 16 year old female I have been following for GHD and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Brain MRI was normal. I just got genetic testing
 that showed two variants of uncertain significance - both heterozygous findings.   One mutation in CCDC141 and another in SEMA3A.  In reading, it looks like SEMA3A can cause Auto Dom IHH but the mutation she has is not yet clear if
 causative.   In speaking more with family after these results, the girl is now having more dental issues - four adult teeth that are missing and poor enamel in all teeth that may require significant treatment in future.   


 


I am going to test parents to see if they have the mutation.   


 


Does anyone have experience with this mutation?


 


Thank you!

109191697,"Delaney, Angela","Oct 24, 2024 4:28pm","Hello, Liat, 
 
I have seen at least one patient with a rare nonsense variant in SEMA3A, and one with a rare missense variant, both heterozygous, and both variants were present in an unaffected parent (suggesting that it’s
 not always autosomal dominant, if these variants were causative).  Neither had hypodontia. 

 
So, while SEMA3A is at this point a pretty well-established IHH gene, this is a great example of how complex IHH genetics is.  You’d have to look at more details about the variant itself to be able to comment
 further on whether it’s causative, but this was presumably taken into account in the determination of “unknown significance” in the report. 

 
I would not discount the possibility that the variant in CCDC141 is contributing as well in an oligogenic fashion, especially since other families have been described that have rare heterozygous variants in
 this gene PLUS heterozygous variants in additional IHH-associated that segregate appropriately with the IHH phenotype (e.g.
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-3391). 

 
Your best bet is to test the parents, as you are planning, but I would suggest testing them for both variants. 

 
Hope this helps!

 bicalutamide is just as effective as spironolactone. However, I prefer spironolactone due to the risk of hepatotoxicity with bicalutamide.
 
If you decide to use spironolactone, it is important to regularly adjust the dose based on weight: 5.7 mg/kg/day divided into two
 equal doses separated by ~12 hours. It’s also important for the parents to hold spironolactone during gastrointestinal illnesses. Also, parents should encourage sodium intake and limit potassium-rich foods.
 
I wouldn’t be surprised if the father was one of our past FMPP patients at the NIH!

You are most likely dealing the same old problem. You don’t have to prove it, just switch HCG to depo-testosterone and check the peak and trough serum testosterone level after giving him the first injection
 by your nurse to prove new treatment will work well for him. You can change the daily GH injection to a weekly one and ask your patient’s father to “help” every weekly injection at least for the first month before you check his IGF-1 level to prove the new
 GH therapy works very well for him as well.

He has panhypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Current medications are:


 


 Genotropin (12 mg pen) 3.2 mg SQ 6 times per week (0.312 mg/kg/week)


 Levothyroxine 88 mcg PO daily


 Hydrocortisone 5 mg PO TID (9.0 mg/m2/day based on BSA of 1.67 m2)


 DDAVP 0.2 mg PO in AM and 0.1 mg PO in PM


 hCG 500 units SQ on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays


 


In August 2023, he had demonstrated good responses to both the growth hormone and hCG with IGF-1 173 ng/mL and trough testosterone level on Wednesday morning prior to that day's injection of 473
 ng/dL.


 


At the last two assessments in January 2024 and October 2024, his IGF-1 levels have been 22 and 25 ng/mL, respectively, and both testosterone levels were 1 ng/dL.


 


His most recent free T4 is in the middle of the reference interval and his serum sodium and serum osmolality are normal.


 


Father has been more attentive to the injections (which the patient does himself) and feels confident that the patient is giving them properly.


 


Is there anything that would explain the low IGF-1 and testosterone values other than non-adherence with the injections?  We discussed potentially trying to put him on one of the weekly growth
 hormone formulations and possibly switching from hCG to testosterone (either injected or topical).  It would be one thing if he did not have a previous response to these therapies, but there was a definite change in lab values from August 2023 to January 2024.


 


Thanks,


Alex

OGTT test result and IGF-1 level are in normal range/not suggestive of GH
