Hypercalcemia Case,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/hypercalcemia_case/109657293,"Good-evening! Our team would like some help re a challenging case of hypercalcemia. Patient is a 15 mo female with a history of developmental delay who recently presented with weight loss of 6 lbs over 2-3 months. She also had vomiting, decrease in appetite, irritability, constipation as well as polyuria prior to presentation. She was admitted to the hospital for further management. She is at the 48th percentile for weight and 40th percentile for length on admission. She had severe hypercalcemia (16.8 mg/dL) on admission with suppressed intact PTH < 6 pg/mL (reference range 15-65). On admission, she has normal Phos 5.7 mg/dL (4.1-6) , low alk phos 80 IU/L (reference range 142-335). 25-OH vitamin D was normal at 36.3 ng/mL. 1,25-OH vitamin D was appropriately low at 10 pg/mL (reference range 40.3-112.4). Repeat Alk Phos consistently low at 70 IU/L. Magnesium was 2.7 mg/dL on admission (1.5- 2.3). Ca/Cr ratio unable to be calculated due to undetectable Cr and Ca Conc, urine was 1.4 mg/dL (0.5 - 35). On admission, Ca conc was 6 mg/dL (but no urine Cr done). Her CBC initially showed WBC 22.5, Hgb 8.1 g/dL, Hct 25%, platelets 489,000, MCV 86.6 and smudge cells visualized. Inflammatory markers were elevated on admission with ESR 35 mm/hr (reference range 0-20) and CRP 32 mg/L (reference range < 10). LDH was normal 210 U/L (reference range 120-246) and uric acid was normal 3.3 mg/dL (reference range 1.7-4.7). Abdominal U/S showed nephrocalcinosis. We were concerned about hypercalcemia of malignancy. Pediatric Heme-Onc recommended further testing which included imaging. CXR negative. MRI of brain and spine negative. Neuroblastoma urine studies pending. PTH-RP recently resulted and is undetectable (< 2 pmol/L). Hematology-Oncology have low suspicion for hypercalcemia of malignancy at this point. Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia. ECHO is normal. Vitamin B6 levels 27.3 mcg/L (3.5 – 65.2). She initially responded to IVF and one dose of Lasix. Calcium came down to normal levels. IVF were stopped and patient started to have better PO intake. Over the last week, she has had increasing Calcium levels. Her ionized calcium is now 1.57 mmol/L (1.09 – 1.30) and corrected serum calcium is 13.6 mg/dL. We have tried Calcitonin for 36 hours and she responded to that but once again has had increasing calcium levels once that was stopped. We have a CGH array pending to evaluate for William Syndrome. Nephrolithiasis panel from Invitae is also pending. Neuroblastoma urine studies pending. What else do we need to consider/missing? Any ideas for treatment options while we await genetic testing which will hopefully be more revealing? Could this still be hypophosphatasia with normal B6 levels?

Thyroid- DIO2 rs225014 homozygous genotype,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/thyroid_dio2_rs225014/110187391,"Hello, I have a 7-year-old patient with autism that has been found to have DIO2 rs225014 homozygous genotype and they are seeking advice on next steps. Thyroid function tests have been repeated multiple times by an outside provider and have largely been normal including negative thyroid antibodies, and normal TSH and free T4. Most recently, T3 testing as below were very mildly low but likely aren't contributing to any of the symptoms family is noting (sweating/heat intolerance, difficulty concentrating/focusing, fatigue, increased hunger, irritability, anxiety).

Metabolic bone disease,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/metabolic_bone_disease/110152592,"Hi everyone! I hope this email finds you well. I was reaching out to you today for your recommendations on a patient in our Cardiac ICU with osteopenia and pathologic fractures. Please find a summary below about her: 10-month-old former 35-week gestation twin with tricuspid atresia, VSD, double outlet right ventricle, mitral regurgitation as well as history of necrotizing enterocolitis who has pretty much lived most of her life in our cardiac ICU. She has been on respiratory support, TPN, diuretics-all risk factors for osteopenia. In October 2024, she sustained a left femur fracture-with routine handling. At that time, she was noted to have a healing right proximal knee femur fracture as well as fracture of the right distal radial metaphysis with diffuse demineralization. At some point she was started on calcium carbonate-current doses 20 mg of elemental calcium per kilogram per day. Her serum calcium and serum phosphorus levels are normal. Serum phosphorus is around 6 mg/dL. Initial vitamin D was 17 ng/ml and most recent vitamin D level is 27ng/ml. Vitamin D supplementation increased from 400 units daily to 600 units daily. Her parathyroid hormone level remains elevated. She now has new bilateral femur fractures. Would you do anything else for her? I know that we sometimes use calcitriol in these patients but given the already high 1, 25 vitamin D I am not sure she needs that. Additionally, I do not know if you would recommend starting phosphorus when her phosphorus is normal. I appreciate any input! Thank you for your time!

This was particularly a question since she seemed to have no virilization, in spite of such a high DHEAS. But since DHEA is also high, that doesn't seem to fit. (although dheas is more elevated than dhea). 3BHSD doesn't fit with low 17OHP and 17OHPreg. Anyone have thoughts on the high DHEAS? Can anyone connect it to the POI? Can someone connect steroid sulfatase deficiency with POI? (FH is positive for lupus - so i was thinking autoimmune poi, but 21-hydroxylase antibody is negative) David W.

MEN-1 and small hepatic lesion,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/men_1_and_small_hepatic/109906651,"I would like your assistance/help/ thoughts on a case. 16-year-old female with history of MEN-1, s/p parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism in 2023. I just saw her a couple of weeks ago, so I sent in for labs and imaging. PTH, calcium, growth factors, BMP, prolactin, all normal. Gastrin level slightly elevated at 75 (< 65). MRI of the abdomen shows a “0.8 cm lesion in the posterior right hepatic segment, which is too small to accurately characterize. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. Bowels and stomach normal.” They recommend ultrasound of the liver in six months to assess for stability. I don’t like the combination of that small lesion and the slightly elevated gastrin level. What are your recommendations for the next step? I appreciate any thoughts and guidance. THANK YOU!

This may be a phone call or maybe even having my patient seen at another center if insurance coverage can be obtained. Any recommendations regarding someone who has a special interest in this area?
