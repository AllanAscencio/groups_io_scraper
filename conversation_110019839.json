Are you saying that karyotype was normal? Even with normal height it is reasonable to look for TS mosaic I think. Or even a deletion of Xq rather than Xp. I would certainly image the ovaries. The normal\n Testo level with elevated DHEA suggests to me that the DHEA may not be coming from the adrenal. There are some reports of gonadoblastomas that can produce DHEA in the setting of POI. I don’t think you know for certain that the DHEA is of adrenal origin unless\n you have done ACTH suppression test, right? did dex suppress the DHEA?\n \nAlso, how were the DHEA and DHEAS assays done?  Possible heterophile antibody interference??\n \nMAL\n\n   \n\nMichael A.

Although the patient is unlikely to have 3 beta HSD, You should have measured 17 OHP and 17 Delta 5 P and DHEA early in AM and perform a 60'cosyntropin to be certain, measure both DHEAS and DHEA at 60 min and after dex suppression. It seems you measured the hormones at 4:33 at least that is what is says above.\n We need to teach younger generations to measure adrenal hormones early AM. That saves a lot of time. I recommend at 7-9 AM\n--\nMichele Zerah, MD"
