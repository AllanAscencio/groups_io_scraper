Hypercalcemia Case,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/hypercalcemia_case/109657293,"Good-evening! Our team would like some help re a challenging case of hypercalcemia. Patient is a 15 mo female with a history of developmental delay who recently presented with weight loss of 6 lbs over 2-3 months. She also had vomiting, decrease in appetite, irritability, constipation as well as polyuria prior to presentation. She was admitted to the hospital for further management. She is at the 48th percentile for weight and 40th percentile for length on admission. She had severe hypercalcemia (16.8 mg/dL) on admission with suppressed intact PTH < 6 pg/mL (reference range 15-65). On admission, she has normal Phos 5.7 mg/dL (4.1-6) , low alk phos 80 IU/L (reference range 142-335). 25-OH vitamin D was normal at 36.3 ng/mL. 1,25-OH vitamin D was appropriately low at 10 pg/mL (reference range 40.3-112.4). Repeat Alk Phos consistently low at 70 IU/L. Magnesium was 2.7 mg/dL on admission (1.5- 2.3). Ca/Cr ratio unable to be calculated due to undetectable Cr and Ca Conc, urine was 1.4 mg/dL (0.5 - 35). On admission, Ca conc was 6 mg/dL (but no urine Cr done). Her CBC initially showed WBC 22.5, Hgb 8.1 g/dL, Hct 25%, platelets 489,000, MCV 86.6 and smudge cells visualized. Inflammatory markers were elevated on admission with ESR 35 mm/hr (reference range 0-20) and CRP 32 mg/L (reference range < 10). LDH was normal 210 U/L (reference range 120-246) and uric acid was normal 3.3 mg/dL (reference range 1.7-4.7). Abdominal U/S showed nephrocalcinosis. We were concerned about hypercalcemia of malignancy. Pediatric Heme-Onc recommended further testing which included imaging. CXR negative. MRI of brain and spine negative. Neuroblastoma urine studies pending. PTH-RP recently resulted and is undetectable (< 2 pmol/L). Hematology-Oncology have low suspicion for hypercalcemia of malignancy at this point. Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia. ECHO is normal. Vitamin B6 levels 27.3 mcg/L (3.5 – 65.2). She initially responded to IVF and one dose of Lasix. Calcium came down to normal levels. IVF were stopped and patient started to have better PO intake. Over the last week, she has had increasing Calcium levels. Her ionized calcium is now 1.57 mmol/L (1.09 – 1.30) and corrected serum calcium is 13.6 mg/dL. We have tried Calcitonin for 36 hours and she responded to that but once again has had increasing calcium levels once that was stopped. We have a CGH array pending to evaluate for William Syndrome. Nephrolithiasis panel from Invitae is also pending. Neuroblastoma urine studies pending. What else do we need to consider/missing? Any ideas for treatment options while we await genetic testing which will hopefully be more revealing? Could this still be hypophosphatasia with normal B6 levels?

Metabolic bone disease,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/metabolic_bone_disease/110152592,"Hi everyone! I hope this email finds you well. I was reaching out to you today for your recommendations on a patient in our Cardiac ICU with osteopenia and pathologic fractures. Please find a summary below about her: 10-month-old former 35-week gestation twin with tricuspid atresia, VSD, double outlet right ventricle, mitral regurgitation as well as history of necrotizing enterocolitis who has pretty much lived most of her life in our cardiac ICU. She has been on respiratory support, TPN, diuretics-all risk factors for osteopenia. In October 2024, she sustained a left femur fracture-with routine handling. At that time, she was noted to have a healing right proximal knee femur fracture as well as fracture of the right distal radial metaphysis with diffuse demineralization. At some point she was started on calcium carbonate-current doses 20 mg of elemental calcium per kilogram per day. Her serum calcium and serum phosphorus levels are normal. Serum phosphorus is around 6 mg/dL. Initial vitamin D was 17 ng/ml and most recent vitamin D level is 27ng/ml. Vitamin D supplementation increased from 400 units daily to 600 units daily. Her parathyroid hormone level remains elevated. She now has new bilateral femur fractures. Would you do anything else for her? I know that we sometimes use calcitriol in these patients but given the already high 1, 25 vitamin D I am not sure she needs that. Additionally, I do not know if you would recommend starting phosphorus when her phosphorus is normal. I appreciate any input! Thank you for your time!

levothyroxine absorption test,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/levothyroxine_absorption_test/110105129,,Melissa Litao,"Dec 13, 2024 6:02pm","Dec 15, 2024 3:29pm",5,True,110105129,"Good afternoon! I have a 14 year old male patient with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (diagnosed March 2023) who remains poorly controlled despite progressively increasing levothyroxine doses. He’s only 41.9 kg but is already on 300 mcg daily of levothyroxine. Most recent labs on this dose show TSH >100 and free T4 0.51. Labs a month ago (on 275 mcg daily) showed TSH 44.3, free T4 0.9. He is on ferrous sulfate, but mom says they give the levothyroxine in the morning and the iron in the evening. Other current medications are lithium (started after diagnosis of Hashimoto’s and levothyroxine initiation), atomoxetine, lamotrigine, montelukast.He’s had one set of completely normal labs (TSH 3.3, free T4 0.95) in January 2024 (on a dose of 125 mcg daily), but other than that TSH has always been elevated, fluctuating between 16 to >100 (with free T4 either low or low normal) despite progressively increasing levothyroxine doses. We started off on 50 mcg daily at diagnosis and have just been going up and up. Labs below:Basically, I do suspect poor compliance, but I’d like to do a levothyroxine absorption test as family is adamant he is not missing doses. I see the protocols that have been referenced here before recommending doses between 600 to 1000 mcg daily. But this adolescent is not adult size (41.9 kg) and so I’m hesitant to use even the 600 mcg dose. I was wondering if it would be worth doing the absorption test but with just his current levothyroxine dose of 300 mcg, which is already a significantly higher dose for his size anyway. One protocol I saw (but also for adults) used a 10 mcg/kg dose for the test but it wasn’t clear what the rationale for that was. Or should I just go ahead and do it with the 600 mcg dose? Thank you for any inputs!Melissa Litao, MDPediatric EndocrinologyOn Wed, May 1, 2024 at 4:34 PM Abdullah Almaghraby via groups.io <Abd-Almaghraby=hotmail.com@groups.io> wrote:

Good afternoon,
 
Can someone please share the protocol that has been sent previously about administering a large dose of levothyroxine in the office and checking thyroid function tests after to differentiate between compliance versus absorption issues?
 
I have a patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma in whom I suspect poor compliance and the TSH has been close to 100 despite increases in the dosage.
 
Thank you!

Patient is a 7 year old who I saw for concern for premature adrenarche.  She started to have pubic hairs around the age of 6, which increased in amount until May 2024.  On exam she was noted to have spare
 pubic hair, but I also noted mild clitoromegaly.  Her growth had also increased from 50th%tile around 4years, to 80th%tile currently.  MPH of 63.5in.  Given growth spurt and clitoromegaly, labs and bone age were done.

Her labs were concerning for elevated testosterone, elevated androstenedione, NORMAL 17OHP and normal DHEAS.

Therefore a US abdomen/pelvis was done initially was concerning for adrenal mass.

Next step was an MRI abdomen, with referral to surgery and Oncology. 

THE MRI was QUITE surprising:

1.  Congenital absence of the portal vein with extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (type I Abernethy malformation).
2.  Multiple hepatic masses are indeterminate and incompletely characterized on this study without use of a hepatocyte specific contrast agent (eg. Eovist) and may represent focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesions, dysplastic nodules, adenomas, and/or fibrolamellar
 or hepatocellular carcinoma in the context of an Abernethy malformation. 

On MRI her ovaries are described as having multiple follicles and look ‘pubertal’.  While NO breast budding was noted on exam: I have an LH and estradiol pending.

 
The finding of elevated testosterone and androstenedione have been reports in “Premature Pubarche, Hyperinsulinemia and Hypothyroxinemia:
 Novel Manifestations of Congenital Portosystemic Shunts (Abernethy Malformation) in Children”. 

At this moment in time, there is no plan for treatment of liver findings. 

 
My biggest question is would you recommended treating her high testosterone and androstenedione? If so with what?

Would you recommend a trial of bicalutamide?

Most of the medications use to treat hyperandrogenism are metabolized thru the liver and I would hesitate to use these.

Am I missing something else I should be looking at?

Adrenal recovery after treatment with mitotane?,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/adrenal_recovery_after/110013198,,"Levenson, Amy Elizabeth","Dec 9, 2024 4:55pm","Dec 9, 2024 5:09pm",2,True,110013198,"Hello all,

I would greatly appreciate any insights or experiences regarding adrenal recovery following treatment with mitotane. I am caring for an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with left cortical adenocarcinoma at age 2. Her treatment included a left adrenalectomy,
 chemotherapy (cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitotane), and approximately 16 months of mitotane therapy, which was discontinued six years ago. She has since been maintained on physiologic doses of hydrocortisone (~8 mg/m²/day) without any other medications.
 She is otherwise doing very well, with appropriate growth and development.

My primary question is whether adrenal function might recover after being off mitotane for several years. Adult studies have reported recovery of adrenal function following mitotane treatment for ACC. Additionally, the recently published international clinical
 practice guideline for pediatric patients treated with mitotane for ACC notes:


""Most of the patients require glucocorticoid replacement using hydrocortisone/cortisone acetate and less frequently mineralocorticoid replacement shortly after beginning. However, after termination of mitotane, it is reversible in the majority of patients."" 
 (Riedmeier, M., et al. (2024). International consensus on mitotane treatment in pediatric patients with adrenal cortical tumors: Indications, therapy, and management of adverse effects.
European Journal of Endocrinology, 190(4), G15–G24. 
https://doi.org/10.1093/ejendo/lvae038)


Has anyone successfully weaned a patient off hydrocortisone after mitotane treatment? If so, how long did it take for the HPA axis to recover? Any guidance or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for your help!

Santosh,
 
It depends somewhat on his age but in general some sort of glucose monitoring should be done every 3 months if he is under 3 years of age, ever 6 months if 3-9 years, and annually if over 9 years.
 Since you are considering teplizumab I presume he is at least 8 years of age? 

 
I would personally have a patient like this wear a CGM and get an A1c in 3 months. Below are the guidance from our recent consensus statement.

 
Where was this kid picked up with antibodies? TrialNet? ASK? Elsewhere?  What was his initial A1c ? Follow up in TrialNet would also offer additional risk information if they are interested.

I recently screened a boy referred to the pediatric endocrine clinic for an elevated HbA1c and he had positive ZnT8 and GAD 65 antibodies. His repeat HbA1c was normal and his fasting glucose was normal. I did an OGTT and his fasting glucose
 was normal (96 mg/dl) and his 2 hour glucose was 134 mg/dl. 

Does anyone know how long it would be prudent to wait until I do another OGTT? I would like to treat him with Teplizumab to delay the onset of symptoms, and I want to catch him when he has stage 2 type 1 diabetes.


I was thinking of repeating the OGTT in six months.

Difficult case of hypoglycemia in a kid with Trisomy 21,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/difficult_case_of/109618284,"Dear all, I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case. Sorry of the lengthy email ! This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has hypoglycemia. She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either. After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked. She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol. Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th % However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection. PROLONG FASTING CHALLENGE: Oct, 2024, after 11 hours of fasting (12 AM): - Glucose: 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL) - Insulin: < 5 pmol/L (< 0.7 mIU/mL) - Beta-Hydroxybutyrate: 2.74 mmol/L [< 0.25] (28.5 mg/dL) - Free fatty acid: subtle elevation in C26:0 - Cortisol: 103 nmol/L (3.7 mcg/dL) - GH: 8.02 mcg/L - Ammonia: 31 [16 - 53] - Plasma amino acid: normal - Urine organic acid: was not collected - Free Carnitine: 17.5 umol/L [26 - 60] - Total Carnitine: 45.1 umol/L [32 - 84] - Acylcarnitine profile: consistent with ketosis. GLUCAGON CHALLENGE: - 00 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL) - 10 min: BG: 2.7 (49 mg/dL) - 20 min: BG: 2.9 (52 mg/dL) I thought these results are consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further. Also, I considered the possibility of metabolic disorders, so the followings were obtained. 21/Oct/2024: [7:58 AM] - Cortisol: 93 nmol/L (3.3 mg/dL) - ACTH: 3.8 pmol/L (17 pg/mL) - Na: 143 [132 - 140] - K: 4.3 [3.5 - 5.2] - Glucose: 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) - Uric Acid: 116 [120 - 300] - Lipid profile: normal - CPK: 237 [33 - 165] Again, the cortisol is low, with perhaps inappropriately normal ACTH? but her sleep cycle is off. So I completed an ACTH stimulation test in addition to obtaining thyroid labs (for pituitary screening) 23/Oct/2024: ACTH stimulation (IV cosyntropin: 125 mcg) - Cortisol 0 min : 123 nmol/L (4.5 mcg/dL) - Cortisol 30 min: 540 nmol/L (19.5 mcg/dL) - Cortisol 60 min: 634 nmol/L (23 mcg/dL) - TSH: 3.1 mU/L [0.34 -5.6] - FT4: 12.7 pmol/L [8-21] (1 ng/dL) So, her cortisol was quite robust! ruling our adrenal insufficiency. Despite the cornstarch, she continued to have symptomatic hypoglycemia. As such, I suggested adding cornstarch (1/2 tablespoon) to all of her feeds (x7/day). I referred her to the genetic department. Her BG actually stabilized nicely after the increase in cornstarch. However, 2 days ago, she started to have lows again. I asked the family to check BG before and after feed to ensure we are not causing iatrogenic hyperinsulinism (dumping syndrome) with the cornstarch but BGs were pretty much the same before and after. feed.

Dr. Levine got the prize for the only person to respond and favored FHH as the most likely diagnosis. Since the initial email: 1. More prodding for family history which included having parents to talk to their parents/family revealed: mother has normal Ca (prenatal labs), father has not had any known lab work/hasn't done any/feels he is healthy and well; but, paternal grandfather had ""calcium issues"" and reportedly may have had at least a partial parathyroidectomy. 2.

Learn why this is important









I have an interesting case of an 8 year-old male who presented for short stature but on further work up was incidentally noted to have hypercalcemia. No stigmata of Williams syndrome. He is an otherwise healthy male without any significant
 medical issues or complaints, he was not on any supplements except Pediasure once or twice daily for low weight concerns.

 


He initially presented to me about a month ago for height -2.7 SDS. Weight was -3.4 SDS, BMI 2nd percentile/-2 SDS. On routine work up: 


 


April 2024 (pertinent labs only):


Total serum Ca 13 mg/dL (albumin 4.6 g/dL) - yikes!


BUN 24/Cr 0.54 - renal function acceptable


phos 3.5 mg/dL - low for age, PTH should be elevated but alas it was not ordered as there was no known concern for hyperCa


alk phos: 391 U/L


TSH 0.9 mIU/L, Free T4 0.8 ng/dL


Normal CBC (no blasts)


Bicarb 24 - no alkalosis


 


Follow up work up to evaluate hypercalcemia ordered but was not completed until a few days ago:


 


June 2024


Total serum Ca 13.7 mg/dL (albumin 4.7 g/dL, corrected Ca for albumin 4 13.1 mg/dL) - yikes!!



BUN 14/Cr 0.45  - rules out CKD


phos 4.1 mg/dL - lower limit of normal for age 


alk phos: 385 U/L - certainly has increased bone turnover


PTH 34 pg/mL (14-85)  - inappropriately normal?


Magnesium 3.1 mg/dL - whoa?



25(OH)D 27 ng/mL - okay


1,25 (OH)2 33 pg/mL (31-87) - okay? should be lower?


8 am cortisol 19.9 mcg/dL - AI ruled out


bicarb 20 


 


Pending: Vitamin A, PTHrP, urine studies (he was not able to urinate at the time of the labs).


The pt is now admitted for hyperhydration with isotonic fluid and further work up (including the urine studies!). 


 


There is no known family history of hypercalcemia (keeping familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in mind - but would that present with a total Ca of 13.7 mg/dL?). Categorically denies any vitamin/Tums/etc supplementation.


 


TL;DR / in summary:


 


8 y/o otherwise healthy and asymptomatic boy who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia with inappropriately normal PTH, alk phos elevation. Etiologies that have been ruled
 out: renal insufficiency, vitamin D toxicosis, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency. 


 


Etiologies: parathyroid adenoma (a bit young? would PTH be higher?) vs MEN1 vs. Malignancy (best next test?) vs FHH vs CYP24A1 variant vs ?


 


Any guidance/advice/comments are greatly appreciated.


 


Thanks!

I recently have been following a 9 month old male for obesity. He was born 39 weeks repeat C section at 3.45 kg and had consistently increasing percentiles to above the 99.9th percentile and is currently 14.15 kg (~31 pounds) and length is at the 90th percentile at 9.5 months old. (growth chart attached is from the PCP). No history of obesity in the family. He is exclusively breastfeeding 5 times per day for 30 minutes with little to no intake of solids. Mother reported rarely breastfeeding overnight but then after further discussion she reported using breastfeeding to soothe the child many times per day and at night. On physical exam he had no shortened metacarpals or subcutaneous nodules, he had 2 cafe au lait macules (one 4x5cm and the other 1cm x0.5cm).  Testes were retractile but palpable. Phallus was 4cm with large suprapubic fat. He also has gross motor delay and is not crawling or pulling to stand but able to sit unassisted. 
 

 
He had some non fasting labs done which revealed an A1c of 5.8%, normal electrolytes, calcium, PTH, TSH and Free T4. Vitamin D was 52nmol/L (20.8 ng/ml). He had microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.1. Total cholesterol was  2.57 mmol/L (99.4 mg/dl). Triglycerides 1.98 mmol/L (175 mg/dl) . HDL 0.71 mmol/L (27.4mg/dl) and LDL 0.96 mmol/L (37 mg/dl)
 
I sent the prevention genetics rare obesity panel which returned positive for 2 heterozygous mutations in the ALMS1 gene of uncertain significance.  (Pathogenic variants in ALMS1 cause autosomal recessive Alstrom syndrome OMIM #203800, characterized by progressive cone-rod dystrophy, hearing loss, childhood obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus Paisey et al. 2019. PubMed ID 20301444). 

 
I have recently graduated fellowship and have not come across this syndrome before and wanted to reach out to the group for any advice for any next steps I should take for further management. I think it would be beneficial for the parents to get tested as well which would be free through the company. I appreciate any advice or comments.

I’m
 writing about a current case that I’m following:


The
 patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother
 had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet.
 There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.


Initial
 labs from that visit:
LH
 = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH
 = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol
 = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin
 = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS
 = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone
 = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone
 = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione
 = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She
 had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”


A
 high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24:
 ACTH Stim test results:
Pre
 => Post
17OHPregnenolone:
 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone:
 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol:
 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA:
 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione:
 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone:
 <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol:
 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone:
 21 => 21 ng/dL


Mild
 elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had
 a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 


Labs
 were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24:
 HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP
 and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH
 = 1.1
LH
 = <0.2
TSH
 = 3.26
Estradiol
 = <15
Midnight
 salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)


10/6/24:
 Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary
 Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)


10/25/24:
 Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any
 recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? 
 
Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient. It’s pretty fun when we actually find the zebras!
Best,

Her mother had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet. There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.

Initial labs from that visit:
LH = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”

A high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24: ACTH Stim test results:
Pre => Post
17OHPregnenolone: 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone: 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol: 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA: 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione: 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone: <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol: 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone: 21 => 21 ng/dL

Mild elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 

Labs were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24: HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH = 1.1
LH = <0.2
TSH = 3.26
Estradiol = <15
Midnight salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)

10/6/24: Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)

10/25/24: Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? 
 
Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient. It’s pretty fun when we actually find the zebras!
Best,
Josh

I would like to get your thoughts on this:
 
7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile 
 at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS.  Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high. 

Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

I was thinking about McCUne Albright syndrome but don’t we expect lower LH and FSH than these or is that should still be considered?

Subject: Growth hormone and brain MRI survey
 
Good morning!
 
One of our medical students is carrying out a survey study to evaluate whether pediatric endocrinologists take peak growth hormone levels on a growth hormone stimulation test to decide the need for a brain MRI and if so, at what peak. Please
 find the information about and the link to the survey below. We appreciate your participation!
 
Dear Pediatric Endocrinology team,
 
We are conducting a study to investigate at what peak growth hormone level do pediatric endocrinologists/nurse practitioners/ fellows order MRI of the brain in children. Results from this survey will be compared to current national guidelines
 and literature to assess the appropriateness of imaging. Participation in this study involves completion of an online survey. Your participation is entirely anonymous. No identifiable information will be collected.
 
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, but your participation would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Shilpa Gurnurkar, MD at
Shilpa.Gurnurkar@.... 

 
The survey should take about 5 minutes to complete. For questions regarding the rights of research participants, call the Nemours Office of Human Subjects Protection: 302-298-7613 or email at
NOHSP@...

She has been doing well with dexcom and omnipod, but it appears she may not be able to continue with this diabetes technology in Chile. It was not clear to me from the manufacturer's websites, can anyone speak to what diabetes technology is available in Chile?
 
Parents would also be appreciative if I could pass on the name of a provider or Peds Endo group where they would be able to establish care in Chile?
 
Thank you

Case - recent change in responses to growth hormone and hCG,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/case_recent_change_in/109179587,,Alex Karmazin,"Oct 23, 2024 6:13pm","Oct 23, 2024 7:31pm",2,True,109179587,"I have a 17 y.o. male patient with history of craniopharyngioma initially diagnosed at age 7 who has had multiple surgical procedures, including VP shunt placement, and radiation treatment.  He had a recurrence in May 2022 and underwent surgical debulking without
 additional radiation.  His recent MRI's have been stable.




He has panhypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Current medications are:




 Genotropin (12 mg pen) 3.2 mg SQ 6 times per week (0.312 mg/kg/week)

 Levothyroxine 88 mcg PO daily

 Hydrocortisone 5 mg PO TID (9.0 mg/m2/day based on BSA of 1.67 m2)

 DDAVP 0.2 mg PO in AM and 0.1 mg PO in PM

 hCG 500 units SQ on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays




In August 2023, he had demonstrated good responses to both the growth hormone and hCG with IGF-1 173 ng/mL and trough testosterone level on Wednesday morning prior to that day's injection of 473 ng/dL.




At the last two assessments in January 2024 and October 2024, his IGF-1 levels have been 22 and 25 ng/mL, respectively, and both testosterone levels were 1 ng/dL.




His most recent free T4 is in the middle of the reference interval and his serum sodium and serum osmolality are normal.




Father has been more attentive to the injections (which the patient does himself) and feels confident that the patient is giving them properly.




Is there anything that would explain the low IGF-1 and testosterone values other than non-adherence with the injections?  We discussed potentially trying to put him on one of the weekly growth hormone formulations and possibly switching from hCG to testosterone
 (either injected or topical).  It would be one thing if he did not have a previous response to these therapies, but there was a definite change in lab values from August 2023 to January 2024.

Santosh,
 
It depends somewhat on his age but in general some sort of glucose monitoring should be done every 3 months if he is under 3 years of age, ever 6 months if 3-9 years, and annually if over 9 years.
 Since you are considering teplizumab I presume he is at least 8 years of age? 

 
I would personally have a patient like this wear a CGM and get an A1c in 3 months. Below are the guidance from our recent consensus statement.

 
Where was this kid picked up with antibodies? TrialNet? ASK? Elsewhere?  What was his initial A1c ? Follow up in TrialNet would also offer additional risk information if they are interested.

I recently screened a boy referred to the pediatric endocrine clinic for an elevated HbA1c and he had positive ZnT8 and GAD 65 antibodies. His repeat HbA1c was normal and his fasting glucose was normal. I did an OGTT and his fasting glucose
 was normal (96 mg/dl) and his 2 hour glucose was 134 mg/dl. 

Does anyone know how long it would be prudent to wait until I do another OGTT? I would like to treat him with Teplizumab to delay the onset of symptoms, and I want to catch him when he has stage 2 type 1 diabetes.


I was thinking of repeating the OGTT in six months.

Difficult case of hypoglycemia in a kid with Trisomy 21,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/difficult_case_of/109618284,"Dear all, I am looking for any suggestions regarding the etiology/management of this challenging case. Sorry of the lengthy email ! This is a-12-month-old female infant with Trisomy 21 and AVSD s/p repair with postop. supraventricular tachycardia (SVD) who has hypoglycemia. She presented to our hospital’s ER on September 17th 2024, with symptoms of lethargy, low energy, and appearing clammy and gray. Upon arrival, her blood BG was 2.6 mmol/L (47 mg/dL). No critical samples were collected, and ketone testing was not performed either. After reviewing her chart, it appears that she had presented with similar symptoms twice before, but no BG was checked. She was on propranolol for SVT and due to these recurring episodes, the cardiology team recommended discontinuing propranolol and was referred to endocrinology the end of September 2024. She is primarily fed via NG tube with Nutramigen formula, consuming around 120-130 ml x7/day. In addition, she eats small snacks in the form of baby food During my first visit with the family, glucometer teaching was completed and I suggested monitoring BG at home hoping that the low BG were related to propranolol. Of note, her weight and length are on the 85th % However, a couple of days later, she started having symptomatic hypoglycemia at home with BG ranging from 2.8 – 3.6 mmol/L (50 – 65 mg/dL). No vomiting, diarrhea or fever. As such, I admitted the patient for a diagnostic fast and critical sample collection.

Given the frequent low BGs, I suggested starting uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg/day, divided QID to be mixed with every other feed basically. I noticed that her cortisol is low, but repeat hypoglycemia is known to cause low cortisol and/or GH. I did not dismiss it, and I investigated it further.

Just wanted to share with you an update on our 13 year old boy with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome who presented with severe recurrent bounts of hypoglycemia with undetectable insulin and C-peptide levels, no ketones and negative tumoral work-up. Anti-insulin antibodies negative. Anti-insulin receptor antibodies (analyzed at research lab in Berlin): extremely elevated levels!!! We had started treatment with RZ358 (Rezolute’s IgG2 allosteric modulating monoclonal antibody that turns down insulin signalling downstream).

As a brief reminder: 8 y/o prev healthy and asymptomatic male who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia (~13 mg/dL corrected for albumin), hypermagnesemia (3.1 mg/dL), with inappropriately normal PTH (34 pg/mL), alk phos elevation (385 U/L), phos 4.1 mg/dL normal 25(OH)D 27 ng/mL. Dr. Levine got the prize for the only person to respond and favored FHH as the most likely diagnosis. Since the initial email: 1. More prodding for family history which included having parents to talk to their parents/family revealed: mother has normal Ca (prenatal labs), father has not had any known lab work/hasn't done any/feels he is healthy and well; but, paternal grandfather had ""calcium issues"" and reportedly may have had at least a partial parathyroidectomy. 2. Urine Ca/Cr was normal (0.11 mass ratio) 3. FeCa 0.45% 4. Genetic testing (proband only) revealed: a variant in CASR c.461C>A (p.Ala154Glu), classified as a VUS, but predicted to be a disruptive missense variant. Family has unfortunately not followed up so I haven't been able to try to get his parents tested. So, I'm left to conclude this most likely is FHH.

Learn why this is important









I have an interesting case of an 8 year-old male who presented for short stature but on further work up was incidentally noted to have hypercalcemia. No stigmata of Williams syndrome. He is an otherwise healthy male without any significant
 medical issues or complaints, he was not on any supplements except Pediasure once or twice daily for low weight concerns.

 


He initially presented to me about a month ago for height -2.7 SDS. Weight was -3.4 SDS, BMI 2nd percentile/-2 SDS. On routine work up: 


 


April 2024 (pertinent labs only):


Total serum Ca 13 mg/dL (albumin 4.6 g/dL) - yikes!


BUN 24/Cr 0.54 - renal function acceptable


phos 3.5 mg/dL - low for age, PTH should be elevated but alas it was not ordered as there was no known concern for hyperCa


alk phos: 391 U/L


TSH 0.9 mIU/L, Free T4 0.8 ng/dL


Normal CBC (no blasts)


Bicarb 24 - no alkalosis


 


Follow up work up to evaluate hypercalcemia ordered but was not completed until a few days ago:


 


June 2024


Total serum Ca 13.7 mg/dL (albumin 4.7 g/dL, corrected Ca for albumin 4 13.1 mg/dL) - yikes!!



BUN 14/Cr 0.45  - rules out CKD


phos 4.1 mg/dL - lower limit of normal for age 


alk phos: 385 U/L - certainly has increased bone turnover


PTH 34 pg/mL (14-85)  - inappropriately normal?


Magnesium 3.1 mg/dL - whoa?



25(OH)D 27 ng/mL - okay


1,25 (OH)2 33 pg/mL (31-87) - okay? should be lower?


8 am cortisol 19.9 mcg/dL - AI ruled out


bicarb 20 


 


Pending: Vitamin A, PTHrP, urine studies (he was not able to urinate at the time of the labs).


The pt is now admitted for hyperhydration with isotonic fluid and further work up (including the urine studies!). 


 


There is no known family history of hypercalcemia (keeping familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in mind - but would that present with a total Ca of 13.7 mg/dL?). Categorically denies any vitamin/Tums/etc supplementation.


 


TL;DR / in summary:


 


8 y/o otherwise healthy and asymptomatic boy who presented for short stature evaluation and noted incidentally to have: hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia with inappropriately normal PTH, alk phos elevation. Etiologies that have been ruled
 out: renal insufficiency, vitamin D toxicosis, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency. 


 


Etiologies: parathyroid adenoma (a bit young? would PTH be higher?) vs MEN1 vs. Malignancy (best next test?) vs FHH vs CYP24A1 variant vs ?


 


Any guidance/advice/comments are greatly appreciated.


 


Thanks!

I recently have been following a 9 month old male for obesity. He was born 39 weeks repeat C section at 3.45 kg and had consistently increasing percentiles to above the 99.9th percentile and is currently 14.15 kg (~31 pounds) and length is at the 90th percentile at 9.5 months old. (growth chart attached is from the PCP). No history of obesity in the family. He is exclusively breastfeeding 5 times per day for 30 minutes with little to no intake of solids. Mother reported rarely breastfeeding overnight but then after further discussion she reported using breastfeeding to soothe the child many times per day and at night. On physical exam he had no shortened metacarpals or subcutaneous nodules, he had 2 cafe au lait macules (one 4x5cm and the other 1cm x0.5cm).  Testes were retractile but palpable. Phallus was 4cm with large suprapubic fat. He also has gross motor delay and is not crawling or pulling to stand but able to sit unassisted. 
 

 
He had some non fasting labs done which revealed an A1c of 5.8%, normal electrolytes, calcium, PTH, TSH and Free T4. Vitamin D was 52nmol/L (20.8 ng/ml). He had microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.1. Total cholesterol was  2.57 mmol/L (99.4 mg/dl). Triglycerides 1.98 mmol/L (175 mg/dl) . HDL 0.71 mmol/L (27.4mg/dl) and LDL 0.96 mmol/L (37 mg/dl)
 
I sent the prevention genetics rare obesity panel which returned positive for 2 heterozygous mutations in the ALMS1 gene of uncertain significance.  (Pathogenic variants in ALMS1 cause autosomal recessive Alstrom syndrome OMIM #203800, characterized by progressive cone-rod dystrophy, hearing loss, childhood obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus Paisey et al. 2019. PubMed ID 20301444). 

 
I have recently graduated fellowship and have not come across this syndrome before and wanted to reach out to the group for any advice for any next steps I should take for further management. I think it would be beneficial for the parents to get tested as well which would be free through the company. I appreciate any advice or comments.

I’m
 writing about a current case that I’m following:


The
 patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother
 had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet.
 There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.


Initial
 labs from that visit:
LH
 = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH
 = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol
 = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin
 = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS
 = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone
 = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone
 = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione
 = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She
 had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”


A
 high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24:
 ACTH Stim test results:
Pre
 => Post
17OHPregnenolone:
 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone:
 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol:
 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA:
 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione:
 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone:
 <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol:
 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone:
 21 => 21 ng/dL


Mild
 elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had
 a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 


Labs
 were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24:
 HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP
 and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH
 = 1.1
LH
 = <0.2
TSH
 = 3.26
Estradiol
 = <15
Midnight
 salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)


10/6/24:
 Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary
 Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)


10/25/24:
 Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any
 recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? 
 
Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient. It’s pretty fun when we actually find the zebras!
Best,

Initial labs from that visit: LH = <0.2 mIU/mL FSH = <0.66 mIU/mL Estradiol = 23 pg/mL Prolactin = 16.9 ng/mL DHEAS = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL Testosterone = 45 (0-40) ng/dL 17OHProgesterone = 60 (<145) ng/dL Androstenedione = 152 (<48) ng/dL She had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal” A high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results: 6/6/24: ACTH Stim test results: Pre => Post 17OHPregnenolone: 109 => 1863 ng/dL 17OHProgesterone: 24 =>302 ng/dL Cortisol: 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL DHEA: 193 => 679 ng/dL Androstenedione: 62 => 159 ng/dL Estrone: <10 => 11 pg/mL Estradiol: 20 => 24 pg/mL Testosterone: 21 => 21 ng/dL Mild elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. Labs were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were: 9/11/24: HgbA1c = 4.9% CMP and Lipid panel = normal. FSH = 1.1 LH = <0.2 TSH = 3.26 Estradiol = <15 Midnight salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09) 10/6/24: Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL Urinary Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18) 10/25/24: Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from. Questions: The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any recommendations? Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up? Thank you for your collective wisdom on this patient.

Best, Josh Joshua Smith, MD, MBA Pediatric Endocrinologist Rocky Mountain Diabetes Center Idaho Falls, ID",Josh Smith,"Nov 7, 2024 8:12pm","Nov 8, 2024 11:42am",6,True,109454640,"I’m writing about a current case that I’m following:

The patient is a 7 year 9 month old female who initially presented with possible early puberty and weight gain. From her initial encounter on 5/7/24: Her mother is 65 inches and her father is 74 inches. Her mid-parental height prediction is 67 inches. Her mother had menarche at the age of 12 and her father has possibly early pubertal progression. They have noticed some breast growth, possibly left greater than right, 1 month ago. She has had pubic hair growth for maybe 1-2 months. She has not had any body odor yet. There is no exposure to testosterone or estrogen creams or AndroGel or Premarin. The exam was more consistent with Premature adrenarche than true precocious puberty. Tanner 2 PH but tanner 1 breast tissue with flesh colored areolas. Mainly lipomastia.

Initial labs from that visit:
LH = <0.2 mIU/mL
FSH = <0.66 mIU/mL
Estradiol = 23 pg/mL
Prolactin = 16.9 ng/mL
DHEAS = 156 (Ref 3-140) ug/dL
Testosterone = 45 (0-40) ng/dL
17OHProgesterone = 60 (<145) ng/dL
Androstenedione = 152 (<48) ng/dL
She had a BA performed at another facility that the parents reported as “normal”

A high-dose ACTH stim test was performed, with these results:
6/6/24: ACTH Stim test results:
Pre => Post
17OHPregnenolone: 109 => 1863 ng/dL
17OHProgesterone: 24 =>302 ng/dL 
Cortisol: 8.5 => 46.4 ug/dL
DHEA: 193 => 679 ng/dL
Androstenedione: 62 => 159 ng/dL
Estrone: <10 => 11 pg/mL
Estradiol: 20 => 24 pg/mL
Testosterone: 21 => 21 ng/dL

Mild elevation in 17OHPreg and DHEA but nothing crazy. I saw her on 9/10/24, 4 months after her 1st visit to determine if there was pubertal progression. At that visit, she had gained 10.04 kg over the previous 4 months. Her height increased by 3.51cm. She had a notable round face and her parents were concerned about the rapid weight gain. She did not have pubertal advancement at that time. 

Labs were performed at a facility about 100 miles from my office but the results were:
9/11/24: HgbA1c = 4.9%
CMP and Lipid panel = normal. 
FSH = 1.1
LH = <0.2
TSH = 3.26
Estradiol = <15
Midnight salivary cortisol = 0.2 mcg/dL (Ref = <0.09)

10/6/24: Midnight Salivary Cortisol = 0.187 mcg/dL
Urinary Free Cortisol = 129.8 ug/day (ref = <18)

10/25/24: Dexamethasone suppression, 1mg taken at 11pm. Cortisol at 0845 = 21.9 ug/dL, ACTH = 49.2 pg/mL
Thus I think I actually have a patient with Cushings! We are trying to get an MRI of the Pituitary to determine where the ACTH is coming from.
 
Questions: 
The family is willing to travel (they live in Twin Falls, Idaho) and would like to go to a center that specializes in Cushings, or at least pediatric experts in this disease. Any recommendations?
Any thoughts on other tests that need to be performed at this time in her work up?

I would like to get your thoughts on this:
 
7 y.o. 5 m.o. female  with early onset of pubic hair and body odor development (6y).

She has familial tall stature (MPH at 90th%ile) , growing just right above the 97th%ile line but since age 6 yrs, there appears to be some acceleration.  Weight has been gradually increasing from 50th%ile at age 2 yrs then to 90th%ile 
 at age 4 yrs then 95th%ile at age 6 yrs and now at >97th%ile.
She has normal 17OHP and slightly elevated DHEAS.  Testosterone was only 7 ng./dL but was reported as high. 

Bone age at age 6y11m was read as 8y10m but my interpretation is that of 10y.  Predicted adult height was 163 cm or 64 inches.
Physical exam during last visit showed Tanner I breasts and Tanner II pubic hair .  The impression was that she likely has benign premature adrenarche but given the bone age advancement , we proceeded with Lupron stim test.

I was thinking about McCUne Albright syndrome but don’t we expect lower LH and FSH than these or is that should still be considered?

Subject: Growth hormone and brain MRI survey
 
Good morning!
 
One of our medical students is carrying out a survey study to evaluate whether pediatric endocrinologists take peak growth hormone levels on a growth hormone stimulation test to decide the need for a brain MRI and if so, at what peak. Please
 find the information about and the link to the survey below. We appreciate your participation!
 
Dear Pediatric Endocrinology team,
 
We are conducting a study to investigate at what peak growth hormone level do pediatric endocrinologists/nurse practitioners/ fellows order MRI of the brain in children. Results from this survey will be compared to current national guidelines
 and literature to assess the appropriateness of imaging. Participation in this study involves completion of an online survey. Your participation is entirely anonymous. No identifiable information will be collected.
 
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, but your participation would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Shilpa Gurnurkar, MD at
Shilpa.Gurnurkar@.... 

 
The survey should take about 5 minutes to complete. For questions regarding the rights of research participants, call the Nemours Office of Human Subjects Protection: 302-298-7613 or email at
NOHSP@...

These patients are generally handled by sub-specialists, leading to potential knowledge gaps. This activity is intended to revisit and provide up-to-date information on disorders affecting growth, such as precocious puberty, Prader Willi Syndrome, and CAH to increase awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. By doing this, we hope to improve medical care for children with potential growth disorders and prevent consequential growth disorders. Additionally, this activity may serve as a referral resource for our community. TARGET AUDIENCE: This course is designed for general pediatricians, pediatric endocrinologists, physician assistants, nurses, medical students, fellows, and residents. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Our special conference will comprise a lecture series with a case-based discussion highlighting the most critical points of the modern approach to conditions affecting growth in children. At the end of the meeting, participants will be able to: 1. Identify the new management guidelines of precocious puberty. 2. Apply up-to-date diagnostic and treatment protocols in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). 3. Understand the update on the endocrinology of Prader-Willi Syndrome 4. Utilize a network of subspecialists for referrals and collaborative care.

I have been caring for an 8 year old from near Talcahuano Chile who was diagnosed with T1D while her father was on assignment to Washington DC. Family is preparing to return home to Chile after 2 years in the states.
 
She has been doing well with dexcom and omnipod, but it appears she may not be able to continue with this diabetes technology in Chile. It was not clear to me from the manufacturer's websites, can anyone speak to what diabetes technology is available in Chile?
 
Parents would also be appreciative if I could pass on the name of a provider or Peds Endo group where they would be able to establish care in Chile?
 
Thank you

Question regarding the treatment/management of SLC5A5-related hypothyroidism,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/question_regarding_the/109304068,"Dear colleagues, I was wondering if anyone had a protocol or treatment plan they have used for the management of patients with SLC5A5-related hypothyroidism [iodide transport defect]? My understanding is that iodine supplementation is the preferred treatment, although I am hoping for a little more guidance with regards to formulations, dosing, and best means of monitoring response to supplementation. Is monitoring thyroid function levels in response to therapy sufficient, or should we also monitor serum/urine iodine levels? Your insights are greatly appreciated.

Case - recent change in responses to growth hormone and hCG,https://groups.io/g/peds-endo/topic/case_recent_change_in/109179587,,Alex Karmazin,"Oct 23, 2024 6:13pm","Oct 23, 2024 7:31pm",2,True,109179587,"I have a 17 y.o. male patient with history of craniopharyngioma initially diagnosed at age 7 who has had multiple surgical procedures, including VP shunt placement, and radiation treatment.  He had a recurrence in May 2022 and underwent surgical debulking without
 additional radiation.  His recent MRI's have been stable.




He has panhypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Current medications are:




 Genotropin (12 mg pen) 3.2 mg SQ 6 times per week (0.312 mg/kg/week)

 Levothyroxine 88 mcg PO daily

 Hydrocortisone 5 mg PO TID (9.0 mg/m2/day based on BSA of 1.67 m2)

 DDAVP 0.2 mg PO in AM and 0.1 mg PO in PM

 hCG 500 units SQ on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays




In August 2023, he had demonstrated good responses to both the growth hormone and hCG with IGF-1 173 ng/mL and trough testosterone level on Wednesday morning prior to that day's injection of 473 ng/dL.




At the last two assessments in January 2024 and October 2024, his IGF-1 levels have been 22 and 25 ng/mL, respectively, and both testosterone levels were 1 ng/dL.




His most recent free T4 is in the middle of the reference interval and his serum sodium and serum osmolality are normal.




Father has been more attentive to the injections (which the patient does himself) and feels confident that the patient is giving them properly.




Is there anything that would explain the low IGF-1 and testosterone values other than non-adherence with the injections?  We discussed potentially trying to put him on one of the weekly growth hormone formulations and possibly switching from hCG to testosterone
 (either injected or topical).  It would be one thing if he did not have a previous response to these therapies, but there was a definite change in lab values from August 2023 to January 2024.




Thanks,
